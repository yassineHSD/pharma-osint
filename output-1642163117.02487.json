(I'm a bot) T. he curious relationship between one of the world's biggest drug makers and President Trump's personal lawyer began early last year when Michael Cohen, a longtime fixer for the president, reached out to Novartis's then-chief executive officer Joe Jimenez, promising help gaining access to Trump and influential officials in the new administration, according to an employee inside Novartis familiar with the matter. The extent to which Novartis conducted any due diligence into Cohen or his track record as a Trump insider and Washington player is uncertain. The meeting was a disappointment, the insider explained, and the Novartis squad left with the impression that Cohen and Essential Consultants - the firm controlled by Cohen that Novartis was making payments to - may not be able to deliver.

Week 2: Also no change in number of migraines/headaches, but the duration seems to be getting shorter (I'm tracking on an app). So far this week, I've been headache free (4 days now! I honestly can't remember the last time I've hit a streak this long!). So I'm pretty optimistic about this. The main difference I've noticed is I'm getting really dizzy at the onset of my migraines now. But like I said, they are much shorter. If anyone has any advice on getting rid of dizziness, I'm open to suggestions.",

I just want Aimovig to work and I'm at the point where I don't even care that I'll have to give myself the shots. My Medicaid might not cover it after the 2 month trial so I'm a lil nervous but why not wait and see.",

Here's my situation: I have headaches 100% of the time, but only a few \"migraines\" per month.  When I say migraines, I am talking about crippling migraine that puts me in bed with an icepack. I recently started getting Botox and my daily headaches have gotten a little better, and I have have had no \"migraines\" in weeks. I can deal with a few a migraines a month - which I don't even have anymore thanks to the botox. What I would fucking LOVE is to fix my daily headaches, but I never really hear any news about that because of the terminology that everyone uses.",

And 16 hours later no problems at all at injections sites. Some dizziness/ wibbly wobbley/ dropping things, but that isn't all that unusual for me since I'm generally in some state of pro or postdrome or active migraine. All that shit just seems to run together. TMI: Did not have my usual \"morning constitutional\" after, so got proactive (as I LOATHE even the slightest bit of constipation) and took a stimulant laxative. Things not moving as usual, but better. Taking another before I go to sleep. Will update with each dose. Good luck to all!",

The FDA is interested in reports of serious or new side effects, not reports of minor side effects that are mentioned in the prescribing information for the drug. If in doubt, I would say report it and they can sort it out. (For example, I would say that the vertigo some people experienced after the injection is something that should be reported.) Here is a link to more information about how to report. This is a totally new class of medication, not a \"me-too\" product, so it's super important that those of you who use it first are vigilant and report any problems. https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/ucm053074.htm",

The 2nd manufacturer hit some hiccups with their plant in S Korea (more of a political issue) nothing with the medicine itself. Should come out in Sept. then the third manufacturer in October, then the last will be December it that one is an IV. She said not a lot of data on the IV Interesting is that there isn't a difference in price between the 70 and the 140. If the prescribe the 140 you get 2 injectors. So she said she is sending in the Rx for the 140 for me!!  Wants me to do the 140 for a couple of months and if I start to really notice a difference then I can do the 70 but will get 2 injections for the price of one. Don't know if Amogen will fix that once the realize it. Let's hope not!  She was originally told it was going to be $50,000 a year, then $20,000 and last year $15,000 so she was happy about the price especially since I do Botox it is cheaper for me to do the CGRP. I am so excited and hope I get the medicine soon!! She also said many people reported being able to challenge themselves with their triggers and doing well with the medicine. For example I can't have any alcohol. It gives me an immediate migraine. So I am hoping in a few months I may be able to have a drink once in awhile!",

It was a little awkward because I had a few questions and the nurse had the worst bedside manner I had ever seen at this office (like...DMV levels of obstinate unhelpfulness). Luckily a more experienced nurse saw this and came over to help me and answer my questions like \"What happens next?\" Fingers crossed. I have butterflies.",

        "Comment": "I just came back from my 3 month follow up with my neurologist and he was actually the one who brought it up. He explained everything about it to me, I honestly haven't done much research on it, and he asked if I wanted to stick with what I'm currently taking (topiramate) or try aimovig. I decided to stick with topiramate, even though I'm still experiencing some tingling in my feet. Why did I choose to stick with topiramate? Truthfully, I'm a little nervous about sticking myself with something, though he swore it didn't hurt and it seems like others in this thread have said the same. But I'm also a little hesitant because of the claims of migraines being reduced ~only~ by 50% or more. Before I started topiramate I had anywhere between 17 and 20 days with a migraine. I've been on it for 3 months and this past month I've only had 3 migraines and their intensity was tolerable. So, I'm slightly nervous that if I start something new I'll revert back to having all those migraines and then what if for whatever reason I'm still getting 8-10 migraines a month? I have to go back to my neurologist in 6 months, so from now until then I plan on following this thread (please share your results!!) and other forums where people discuss aimovig to see everyone's progress and then take it from there. Only issue is that a month or so after my next appointment I will be without insurance so if I did want to switch I'm not exactly sure how I'd be able to pay for the medicine. So, like many people have said before, please continuing sharing all of your experiences!",

        "Comment": "I highly doubt this will be seen here, but per Mod direction, here goes: I got a call last week from the Aimovig Ally team, welcoming me to the trail program, etc. I specifically asked when my shot would arrive, and I was told since it was Thursday when they were calling, it probably wouldn't be sent until Monday because of overnight shipping weekend restrictions, blah blah whatever. Ok, fine. So that would have it arriving by Tuesday at the latest. Still nothing today, so I call and now the story has changed to - Oh, oops, we just got your information last week. The actual prescription wasn't processed until yesterday, and it will be at least another 24-48 hours before the pharmacy team calls to schedule my delivery. Which means it will be Thursday again, so we're back at shipping on Monday, arriving Tuesday, if I'm lucky. Maybe I'm just overly cranky about this whole situation, but my head is killing me today and I'm just so ready for any kind of relief. I was told originally from the time they got my paperwork from the doctor, I would have a shot in my hands in 3 business days. I just want to cry. Anyone else having shipping issues with the trial program?",

I currently do not take any preventive meds except for vitamins(magnesium, CoQ10 etc), and I do Botox. The Botox helped but not enough to justify the cost so I will probably stop that once I get the Aimovig. My friend is Austin got her Rx 4 days after me and already got a call about it!

They ordered the med and had it for me next day.  I paid for mine in full as my deductible hasn't been met yet.  It was $569 and change.  I was prescribed 140mg so two shots which i did both in my left thigh.  There is some hot swelling at one of the sites, but not bad.  I agree with others.  It stung while going in but nothing like Imitrex or Sumatriptan.  I feel a little woozy but I also took Rizatriptan an hour ago since today is not a good headache day.  I have daily chronic headache and have for as long as i can remember.  I had my first migraine when i was seven.  My doctor said that the studies were more for migraine relief than for chronic headache, but is hopeful that i will see results in the daily pain.  I never don't have a headache.  It just might be a good headache day or a bad one which will lead to a migraine if i don't attempt to stop it with ibuprofen, then Excedrin and then finally Rizatriptan as it progresses.  Looking forward to following this and hearing how everyone does!  Good luck getting your prescriptions filled and with feeling better!  Oh and btw, this is my first ever Reddit post :)",

I still haven't had a completely headache free day, but my headaches/migraines are less severe, I'm bouncing back quicker, and I'm experiencing more headache-free time each day. This has been subtle physically but has been pretty epic for me mentally. I cannot describe the joy and relief to be able to move through the world pain free even for just a little time each day and be able to focus and to be present. It makes me aware of how much of the time I have been just pushing through and the depths of the anxiety feedback loop living with migraine has created. I'm not free of either right now, but to feel the weight lighten is incredible. It occurred to me as I was saying this to a friend that there is a whole community of people who don't just know my physical pain, but know the mental anguish, the frustration, the constant exhaustion both from the mental and the physical, the anxiety of not drinking enough water or getting enough sleep or sitting next to some A#$hole with too much perfume. And I just want to say that you guys are amazing and strong and whether this drug works or some other drug, or a diet shift or acupuncture or anything, we all got to keep up hope. They say that people feel more effects in months two and three so I'll continue to update.  Much love y'all.",

        "Comment": "Alright so I read your other post and I gotta say that sounds like quite the change and I hope you get back to full. I will say that I got into fasting and stuff to work with that, you might have better luck with even one meal a day but there are diminishing returns to it and it can be kind of difficult getting all the calories in 3 or 4 hours. Ive personally been doing like 2 days of dry fasting every 2 weeks and some meal timing stuff which is easier than doing OMAD while still keeping me feeling OK when having lots of ice cream and like a gallon of milk. Just curious do you think the dairy thing was recent? I know one person I helped cure through here (granted it was their own pee) got dairy allergies I think after a few months or like a year or so of having at least liver flukes and maybe some other stuff, I think her family handled dairy fine though. As to sources for triclabendazole, I just used ebay -- it's sold for trematodes that can effect fish, but it should be the same (and of course only) drug used for them, and someone else said it worked great for him when I suggested it to him (a while ago on a different subreddit, but I'm fairly certain it was the same seller as there was probs only one on there. As to the urine, I would try to have it on an empty stomach for a few hours for a few days, which will be easier if you already do intermittent fasting. When you wake up it's the strongest. As to the sweet annie, I remember looking a fair bit online for sources, but the most I could find where oil pills, that were very expensive and probably only somewhat effective. If you have a local apothecary, you might have good luck there. Would probably work well in tangent with the urine, and something you could have as a mix of empty stomach + meals -- although you might need like 2 or 3 cups worth of tincture, over a few days. Preferably soften them up with urine if you go that path for a few days, to make it more reliable. Good luck. Keep us updated. Also, you say it mightve been from raw fish in spain? Are you sure you didnt have liver or some weird water?",

        "Comment": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) starts early, even in childhood.1,2 Non-invasive imaging in the PESA (Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis) study revealed that 71% and 43% of middle-aged men and women, respectively, have evidence of subclinical atherosclerosis.3 Extensive evidence from epidemiologic, genetic, and clinical intervention studies has indisputably shown that low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is causal in this process, as summarized in the first Consensus Statement on this topic.4 What are the key biological mechanisms, however, that underlie the central role of LDL in the complex pathophysiology of ASCVD, a chronic and multifaceted lifelong disease process, ultimately culminating in an atherothrombotic event? This second Consensus Statement on LDL causality discusses the established and newly emerging biology of ASCVD at the molecular, cellular, and tissue levels, with emphasis on integration of the central pathophysiological mechanisms. Key components of this integrative approach include consideration of factors that modulate the atherogenicity of LDL at the arterial wall and downstream effects exerted by LDL particles on the atherogenic process within arterial tissue.",

The affordable care act  that Clinton is championing, also forces Americans to pay, and worse the money is going to the pharmaceutical industry. There in lies the difference. Hillary Clinton champions a plan that makes us to pay the healthcare industry a higher cost for subpar care. Bernie Sanders champions up plan  that makes us pay the government for  A lower cost of better care.",

Califf has deeper ties to the pharmaceutical industry than any FDA commissioner in recent history. He ran a multimillion-dollar clinical research center at Duke University that received more than 60 percent of its funding from the pharmaceutical and medical device industry. And his financial disclosure form last year listed seven drug companies and a device maker that paid him for consulting and six others \u2013 including Merck, Novartis and Eli Lilly \u2013 which supported his university salary.\" Pretty damming if you ask me. I don't see how this could be spun as anything other than actually getting the candidate vetted before blindly accepting the nominee. EDIT - a word",

I remember seeing a report filled with various info graphs regarding the rising costs of pharmaceuticals and how they skyrocketed during the Bush administration and while congress was led by Republicans, all due to deregulation. Anyone have any resources or links they could direct me towards so that I could get more info on this subject? P.s., Yes. I did try various searches; however, and I found it interesting, but I didn't get a single relative hit regarding pharmaceutical deregulation in the US. Update: Changing my search engines yielded better results. Still, Bing yielded very little to no relevant results.  But, it is Bing.......",

Findings  In this cohort study of 255 infants born between March and December 2020, exposure to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection was not associated with differences on any Ages & Stages Questionnaire, 3rd Edition, subdomain at age 6 months, regardless of infection timing or severity. However, both exposed and unexposed infants born during that period had significantly lower scores on gross motor, fine motor, and personal-social subdomains compared with a historical cohort of infants born before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meaning  These findings suggest that birth during the COVID-19 pandemic, but not maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection, is associated with differences in neurodevelopment at age 6 months.",

She\u2019s still a child, driven to the brink of madness and beyond by her experiences with the cult, including the experimentation and being sold off to a Brothel, so it probably brought out the protective instincts in a lot of them. The D G Cult is so horrific we know that thousands of children were kidnapped, enslaved and experimented upon, but only 3 of them are known to have survived. Given how Arianrhod treats Ennea (another survivor) like a daughter, and she\u2019s the big moral good of the society, I can see most of them having at least protective instincts over a girl who\u2019s still a child that\u2019s broken enough to only exist as an enforcer until someone finally is able to reach out.

        "Comment": "You are talking about what Novartis (maker of Cosentyx) calls their \"Covered until you're covered\" program. It is exactly what you say. Zero $$ from you for up to two years while receiving your Cosentyx directly from them. I was on this program for a few months while we worked with my insurance company to cover it. Worked flawlessly. Zero questions from them, other than \"what's your address?\" and \"do you have any allergies?\" When my dermatologist and I decided to go from Humira (working fairly well, but still had big flares occasionally) to Cosentyx, she made a call to Novartis and within 4 days I was taking my first loading doses. Now, Novartis won't do this if there isn't some high potential for upside to them. So their strategy is to get you to show improvement on their dime so your dermatologist has a compelling argument for your insurance carrier. Cosentyx has shown good success so far (not 100%, no biologic works for everyone) so they expect a high percentage of patients they help to get covered under insurance. Now, your insurance carrier surely knows about this program. They may drag it out a bit before covering you. I think the important thing is to work with your dermatologist / rheumatologist to communicate with the insurance company about what their threshold is for covering you. I know it's not really that simple. It probably is important to understand if they require a tiered approach (UVB, MTX, topicals) before going to biologics and if they'll bypass that if you show clearing with Cosentyx. Good luck. I have close to full clearing. I am 100% active again and my P isn't the first thing somebody sees when meeting me for the first time. EDIT: Wanted to add. Once you are covered under insurance, Novartis has their copay assistance program where they will cover up to $16,000 annually (from their website as of this morning) against your deductible and copays. This is quite generous and will cover most high deductible plans.",

Unfortunately if your insurance still denies you after two years then you\u2019re probably going to have to switch to something else, because it is quite expensive without insurance/copay assistance.",

        "Comment": "The key is \u201cfailure\u201d on previous medication, but it is important to know that failure does NOT mean that the previous medication had 0% success. It can mean several things: Example 1: patient tried methotrexate but had mild stomach upset. Example 2: Patient tries formulary approved biologic drug XYZ and gets 40% clearance but is still miserable. This is considered failure (because at least 90% could be possible with another drug, but don\u2019t know until it is tried) Example 3: patient tries formulary approved biologic XYZ and is getting results but is having terrible injection site reactions. This is considered failure. If you can get copay assistance to start the medication and report back to your doc that you\u2019re having great results in a couple of months, they should be able to resubmit the application for approval with your insurance company. It\u2019s harder for them to reject it when you\u2019re already on the medication and showing good results. I have personally experienced all of the \u201cfailures\u201d listed above in my 15 years of dealing with psoriatic arthritis and battling insurance companies, but a person need only experience one such event as evidence to move on to another drug. Even if drug XYZ was \u201csort of\u201d working, be honest with your doctor if you\u2019re still miserable. Make sure your experiences (including how psoriasis affects you emotionally/psychologically), all side effects and concerns are well documented in your records. And make sure your doctor is really making a good case to the insurance company versus just checking the boxes and submitting a generic approval form. Finding a doctor (and/or their staff... don\u2019t even get me started, lol), who will fight for you is half the battle. It takes time, but this approach has worked for me. I\u2019m on Taltz now and liking it so far. Hope Cosentyx works for you. Good luck!",

Bidens infrastructure spending bill will be a huge tailwind for CVX where over 100000 bridges alone in US are in desperate need of upgrade. Across Canada there are plenty for CVX In Ontario there are 96 bridges in need of repair and could use CVX s revolutionary cement technology. Highways roads and many other areas could use CVX cement technology. International cement giant Lafarge and few other giants are a customer of CVX and or have close associations with one another. Recently 2 institutions have started coverage with a buy recommendation and a target price of $1.25  CVX recently added that by moving some of their big contracts to 2022 they expect to have a revenue well over $30 to $40 mil At .385c CVX is extremely undervalued and perfect time to get in The recently done private placement at .65c has a strike price of .81c This means for institutions to cash their warrants they have to push the stock up to .81c to cash in their warrants So buying now you are easily make over 100%",

        "Comment": "GMOs themselves aren't harmful, the issue that the informed people have with them is the ecological impact of the pestisides that are sprayed on them. Most crops that are commercially farmed are genetically engineered to be resistant to glyphosate (Roundup). As of right now the USDA and FDA are saying glyphosate is safe. I'm not disagreeing with you that gmo farming is the best current method of farming, it uses less space and resources than traditional farming. Glyphosate can cause mutation to amphibious life forms and fish, it is literally in every food item in amounts that are concerning. So maybe a little bit here and there won't kill you, but a lifetime of microexposures could have the potential for medical complications. The more Roundup we use the more super weeds we spawn the more Roundup we need, this current form of pestiside use is not sustainable longterm. We need to be more responsible with this substance that has contaminated our entire food supply. Slightly unrelated, Monsanto Bayer has done nothing in their history as a company to gain the trust of the American people. They lied about the safety of many chemicals they have manufactured to keep selling them, PCBS, DDT, and Agent Orange. Why should we trust them about glyphosate when that is one of their top sellers?

We don't know the long-term consequences of consuming genetically modified organisms. You also have to understand that there are huge lobbying interests at play. The FDA, for example, is notorious for both its incompetence and corruption when it comes to approving foods that are dangerous. Here's an interesting real-life case. Cyclamates- they were marketed as an alternative to sugar for diabetics, and the company that tried to get its approval in foods had done its own shitty tests that would have been grounds for rejection. But instead the FDA went out of its way (you can probably guess why- money) to do its own tests (which indicated danger), and approved it. Decades later it was shown to cause a certain type of cancer.",

        "Comment": "Let's a dress the real heart of the issues with gmo while we are at it. People refuse gmo crops because they are chemically doused with glyphosphate i.e round up., the same cancer causing chemical where Bayer is loosing court cases on and it will continue to loose, because people are dying from non-hodgkins lymphoma, cancer. If that's not bad enough the weeds are becoming  super resistant to round up to the point where it is no longer effective, search superweeds, nasty and can only be killed by hand, barely. These round up super weeds can bring a combine to a dead halt. And the farmers that can kill the super weeds, they have to use more and more round up to do it. which raises prices and exponentially increases soil and water toxicity. everyone suffers except Bayer and monsanto. To make matters worse for farmers, they can be sued if their neighbors crop pollinate their crop, and since the gmo seeds are patented, it is illegal to grow next year's crop from last year's seeds. which farmers have done since the being of agriculture, making farming even more expensive, which means your food prices go up even more. to summerize: gmo crops are bread to be resistant to cancer causing roundup that stays in foods even after washing. Monsanto can sue your neighbor if your gmo crops pollinate their field, and it is illegal to grow next year's crop with last year's seeds. The monoculture and round up destruction is highly unsustainable and we can see evidence of this yesterday, today and tomorrow. Sounds like a dystopian future to me. Chemical pesticides are destroying our land, and water supplies. They are literally killing people from the toxicity of cancer causing round up. Farming becomes more expensive, the food on your table get more expensive with no added benefit.",

And I dont just mean the ones whose fields get pollinated with the GMOs genetics by accident but anyone. Farmers own nothing now and are getting bullied by the companies who do GMO crops. Also GMO is very expensive and only marginally better than older hybrid breeding techniques. Some GMO plants are just made to be more resistant to pesticides and herbicides so that they can just have chemicals dumped on them. I'm not saying we shouldnt use pesticides and herbicides at all (that would be crazy) but we need to be encouraging better cultural farming practices that deter pests first and using those chemicals as a last resort. But instead we are just using them in excess as a primary pest  management just for good measure because is simpler. GMOs are facilitating that. And the same companies that produce GMOs are also selling those chemicals.nt Any technique that gives us better more resilient crops is a good thing definitely but they are being used by big business in a lot of unsavory ways.",

        "Comment": "I'm a Brit and our unloved stock market is full of gems. I went through the entire FTSE 100, 250 and AIM to pull out all the dividend growers. There are a lot. My criteria was that they must have increased their dividends between 2015 and 2019. I'm less fussed about 2020 but I'm staying away from industries that have taken a hit from covid. Just be wary of the FTSE 100 dinosaurs who offer good dividends but their markets are stagnating (oil, tobacco, big insurance). The UK has a lot of world leading mid-cap pharmaceuticals. There are also interesting companies like SONG that buys up the rights to music royalties from major musicians. I also like warehouse REITS like BBOX - they rent out behemoth warehouses to Amazon and the like and yield over 4% with quarterly payouts.",

        "Comment": "The best thing for Germans to be more keen on the EU Project is a better acting and performing EU. 3 Things happend that really pushed people here back: The failure of vaccine buying in Europe first, which cost many people their life. It is massively regarded as an dysfunctional EU failure, as the some countries in the EU pushed the block to pay low and not get what it could. Also the failure to sign most of the EU vaccines by Biontech, as nationalistic approaches by France, Sweden and other forced to sign contracts for vaccines that failed to perform well it be produced enough. The post covid economy fond. Germany stands for like 170 Billion of that Bill, gets around 30 Billion back. The audacity to tell the Germans what to do with that money the debt is five times over they sum getting back really rubbed some nerves. The entire thing is highly unliked here because transfers of money or guarantees for other states debt are factual forbidden and extremely unpopular.  But when you become the biggest financer and get told what you have to do with the cents you get back, people really grinded their gears. The constant EU powergrab: The Bundesverfasssungsgericht (German Constitutional Court, highest court we have) is the most well regarded public institution, far above parliament or chancellor. That they are fought so heavily now by the powergrabers, who constantly go above and beyond the contracts, is pretty much by nobody well received. Especially because the ruling that sparked it, was received as mild and a golden olive branch, as it did not stop anything or threw a wrench into a questionable state finance program. It just asked for information and that was it. Then there is now the powergrab in digital media. The EU has no regulation in digital media outside of the outdated 20 years old e commerce guideline. It constantly failed to regulate and watched hoe Ireland and others dodged to regulation. Now Germany starts it's regulation and what comes out of it? Brussels goes aggressive and threatens to block it, because it might conflict with a non existing regulation, that might come 2022. A regulation that Brussels promised would not interfere with national regulations. Jokesters. The last year just has been a very weak performance by the eu governance. Covid, Hungary and Poland, refuges, no matter the problem, the eu looked weak. And it took a toll. If they want to turn it around, they don't need German politicians to speak new speak about the EU. They just need to perform better.",

But now we have to follow Brussels' rules :( This sadly used to work, because national media ignores EU institutions mostly. It also works on a lot of people that only read news, but none of the political magazines (that take time to drill into issues, and not only report 'fresh'). But the citizens recognize the scheme now, and this has turned a lot of people against the EU.",

This is also why I find the current hostile stance towards Hungary and Poland to be quite worrying.

Eastern European countries deciding that going back 500 years is the best choice (or even becoming more and more foreign agents within the EU, see Hungary), the drama about the transfer of finances towards mainly Southern Europe who haven't even used prior funds properly or fully in the past, all the time while the EU cannot move forward because we need all States to agree on everything... I don't know, it just has been leaving me more frustrated than ever. Also the comments calling for Germany to take a more central role in the EU are kind of amusing. Hasn't Merkel done just that in the last years and caused huge outcry over it? Be it the case with Covid or with Greece in the past (where some people still seem to blame Germany for all its problems, which I find odd). Whenver Germany has an answer that isn't an easy one, everyone seems to tell us to bugger off. Kind of a weird paradox where people want Germany to lead, but only in a way they approve.",

I've been asked by people in their 50 or 60 (you know, the kind you expect to have reached a level of general knowledge about the world) if i came to Germany as a refugee. The young are hardly better. They live in this delusion that Germany is supporting the rest of lazy europe while they gain nothing. I think the vaccine blunders and the recent failure of their catastrophe warning system may have deflated them a bit, but underneath their apparent modesty and politeness it is still \"deutschland \u00fcber alles in der welt\".",

This new high cost is the result of the healthcare proclamation that Trump tried to pass, which has been temporarily blocked, but until when is unknown. Currently and  without the healthcare proclamation being passed the healthcare would have cost a lot less, at $400 each a month.. This new order doesn\u2019t allow new (tax paying and working) immigrants to use healthcare credits within the health care marketplace. In the UK as an immigrant  you pay \u00a3200 a year for unlimited free care (called a surcharge) each year your visa is valid until you become a citizen. Yeah, you may wait in line a little longer and the hospitals may not be shiny and seem gloomy in comparison, but thats because they don\u2019t profit from the people\u2019s misery and grief.  The staff are just as professional and dedicated to helping their patients just as they are anywhere in the world.

        "Comment": "Well I'm a bit late here, but first, thanks for typing up such a detailed review. Let me respond to what I think is the key point here: Simply put, Sen no Kiseki is a good JRPG game, but only a decent Kiseki entry. So much more could\u2019ve been done to it, and so much didn\u2019t need to be removed and then carelessly replaced through the transition from Ao. I\u2019m so critical of it not because I want to hate it, but because I know it could have been far more. After Zero and Ao showed me how far Falcom can go with their storytelling, I am not convinced that this is the best they can do. The Crossbell arc is my favourite part of the series so far, and Cold Steel my least favourite. But to be fair, Falcom set themselves a hard task for Cold Steel: making an \"entry point\" to attract new players and introduce them to the massive world of Trails, without boring old players. So the writers bundled up the huge amounts of knowledge they needed to convey into a rigid structure. Each character represented/personified one facet of the world, and each chapter explores some facets of the world through the corresponding characters' back-stories. That way, the \"Zemuria for Dummies\" material isn't totally repetitive for returning players: the specific details of the characters are still new to you even if the background knowledge isn't. The result wasn't amazing, but it was a hard balance to strike. Zero and Sky FC never had to balance those two disparate goals. Sky FC could focus solely on introducing Zemuria, without worrying about returning players. And Zero was not an \"entry point\": it could have a great complicated story & system because players are expected to know a lot about the world already - bracers, orbments, sepith, Erebonian Empire, Ouroboros, Joshua & Estelle & who they're pursuing, etc. IMO Cold Steel II was the bigger disappointment: it was marginally better than the first game, but it really should have been leaps & bounds better, because Falcom weren't facing any of the limitations of an \"entry point\" game. In particular II had no excuse for its formulaic, repetitive chapter structure. Some comments on specific details: I liked the new fishing system better. Never got the hang of the old-style fishing with no visual indicator whatsoever, just pressing a button at the beep. IIRC the CP 0 and instant death \"anti-bonuses\" first appeared in Sky 3rd, and also show up in the Crossbell arc in the dungeons where higher elements are active, so this one's not really Cold Steel's fault. Arcus and lack of Orbment lines - Akatsuki brings back Enigma II , probably because UserJoy has figured out that's what fans want. And floor tile highlights on the battlefield too ( see the new video ) Re: \"And that brings us to one of the final dungeon\u2019s main attractions, Sen spoiler\", well, Crossbell also gave us Ao spoiler Crossing the Nord Highlands a few times by horse was nowhere near as painful as that stupid shoe-testing quest in Sky FC",

If you look at a list of Finnish municipalities by population you'll see that Helsinki is by far the biggest (650k), followed by 5 cities in the 200k-300k region: Espoo, Tampere, Vantaa, Oulu, and Turku. Espoo and Vantaa I rule out, because they're in the Helsinki metro area, grown into it. Combined the capital region has a population of a little over 1 million, you generally think of it as one unit. It's kinda like San Francisco-Oakland-San Jos\u00e9, three large cities grown into one megacity. Though if the Bay Area is a megacity, the capital region in Finland is a kilocity at most. That leaves out Tampere, Oulu, and Turku. I'd argue that Tampere has the best case for being the 2nd city, since the Tampere region is the 2nd largest metro area in Finland with a population of roughly 400 000 people, but Turku has a pretty good case for itself too, due to it being a more historically significant city. Oulu is larger than Turku, but it's so far north that for people like me who live in the southern parts of the country it doesn't really pass my mind too often. So I guess the answer is no, Finland doesn't have a prominent third city. I'd say that the capital region is the city no. 1, Tampere is 2A, Turku is 2B and Oulu either 2C or 3, whatever you want.",

But even though it has some challenges ahead, the lack of investment, the low possibilities to grow (there are only two, by north or by the villages around it), crime, lowrents and its rivalry with Malaga in tourism, culture and more. I live in Seville and those are the main problems we have to grow. I can't say a lot of Valencia, because I have never been there, lived there or investigated a lot. So if anyone knows I would like to know a little more about the challenges of Valencia. There are also other notable mentions like Bilbao, Malaga or Santiago de Compostela.

        "Comment": "We have Izmir with 4.3 million population. It doesn't fit into your description. It was historically the most important city after Istanbul, and used to be the 2nd city until few decades before. The secular culture and mild climate of Izmir attracts more people every year. 2020 was the first year when Istanbul lost population. While, Izmir became the city with highest immigration. (That's what I remember, maybe I'm wrong on some details.) Istanbul dominates the country in all aspects with its 15 million population. People critize the focus on Istanbul while the other big cities are ignored. Ankara (5.6 million), Izmir and Bursa (3.1 million) are notable cities outside the Istanbul. As I know, Istanbul and Ankara have more job opportunities than Izmir. At least in my career, architecture. Bursa is the major industrial powerhouse and does not fit into your the description either. (but I know nothing much about it to give details) Also, there are other 5 cities larger than 2 million population in Turkey. They are more regional as your description. This number increases to 20 if we look at 1M+ population. Some of them are just really ordinary cities. That's why, it was always surprising to see many important European cities with 1 or 2 million population.",

The battle for 2nd and 3rd is then between the next two settlements, Akureyri and Keflav\u00edk. Both are similar sized but Akureyri usually takes this crown being a beautiful town with a unique sense of identity, a popular destination for locals and tourists alike and a vital service centre for the whole of northern Iceland. (Totally not biased in any way) That leaves Keflav\u00edk as the third city. It's undeniably bigger than the remaining towns, but its home to the airport... and not an awful lot else. Not to mention it has something of \"reputation\" to many Icelanders. It's the place you drive past on the way to/from the airport but you rarely if ever stop there.",

        "Comment": "For the UK as a whole, London and Edinburgh are the two most important by virtue of being capitals. For the third, I\u2019d say Manchester, followed very closely by Glasgow. Manchester makes up the centre of the Northern Powerhouse, the industrial-economic spine of northern England and the Midlands, as well as a keystone between England and Scotland. Meanwhile, Edinburgh may be the brain of Scotland, but Glasgow is the heart - the most heavily populated, most central, and most culturally influential. I\u2019m putting it just behind Manchester purely because it doesn\u2019t connect to the rest of the country in the same way - as a city in itself, Glasgow beats Manchester. If we\u2019re talking about just England, I\u2019d say Leeds-Bradford followed by Birmingham. Leeds is the (informal) capital of Yorkshire, a comparatively vast region of England with frankly immense industrial power; but it also holds most of the north\u2019s media and cultural influence, especially when combined with Bradford. Birmingham, meanwhile, is England\u2019s second-most populous city, and the centre of the English Midlands. I\u2019m placing it behind Leeds-Bradford because the latter has influence over the whole north, while Birmingham influences a smaller area, and has less economic power.",

Blocking the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in vitro completely abolished the suppression of T-cell proliferation by MSCs and restored T-cell expression of CD25 as well as responsiveness to interleukin-2. In vivo, administration of MSCs significantly reduced delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to allogeneic antigen and profoundly prolonged the survival of fully allogeneic islet grafts in transplant recipients.

        "Comment": "Multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs) are adult adherent stromal stem cells currently being assessed in clinical trials for acute graft versus host disease with demonstrated immunomodulatory capabilities and the potential to ameliorate detrimental autoimmune and inflammation-related processes. Anti-CD3/anti-CD28 (3/28) activation of T cells within the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) compartment was performed in the presence or absence of MAPCs. Liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry was used to characterize the differential secretion of proteins, and transcriptional profiling was used to monitor mRNA expression changes in both cell populations. Overall, 239 secreted and/or ectodomain-shed proteins were detected in the secretomes of PBMCs and MAPCs. In addition, 3/28 activation of PBMCs induced differential expression of 2,925 genes, and 22% of these transcripts were differentially expressed on exposure to MAPCs in Transwell. MAPCs exposed to 3/28-activated PBMCs showed differential expression of 1,247 MAPC genes. Crosstalk was demonstrated by reciprocal transcriptional regulation. Secretome proteins and transcriptional signatures were used to predict molecular activities by which MAPCs could dampen local and systemic inflammatory responses. These data support the hypothesis that MAPCs block PBMC proliferation via cell cycle arrest coupled to metabolic stress in the form of tryptophan depletion, resulting in GCN2 kinase activation, downstream signaling, and inhibition of cyclin D1 translation. These data also provide a plausible explanation for the immune privilege reported with administration of donor MAPCs.   .......   SIGNIFICANCE: This study documents experiments quantifying solution-phase crosstalk between multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The secretome and transcriptional changes quantified suggest mechanisms by which MAPCs are hypothesized to provide both local and systemic immunoregulation of inflammation. The potential impact of these studies includes development of a robust experimental framework to be used for preclinical evaluation of the specific mechanisms by which beneficial effects are obtained after treatment of patients with MAPCs.    ....this from  ..... http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26494783",

In addition to multilineage differentiation capacity, MSCs regulate immune and inflammatory responses, providing therapeutic potential for treating diseases characterized by the presence of an inflammatory component. The availability of bone marrow and the ability to isolate and expand hMSCs ex vivo make these cells an attractive candidate for drug development. The low immunogenicity of these cells suggests that hMSCs can be transplanted universally without matching between donors and recipients. MSCs universality, along with the ability to manufacture and store these cells long-term, present a unique opportunity to produce an \"off-the-shelf\" cellular drug ready for treatment of diseases in acute settings. Accumulated animal and human data support MSC therapeutic potential for inflammatory diseases. Several phase III clinical trials for treatment of acute Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) and Crohn's disease are currently in progress.

(I'm a bot) T. he curious relationship between one of the world's biggest drug makers and President Trump's personal lawyer began early last year when Michael Cohen, a longtime fixer for the president, reached out to Novartis's then-chief executive officer Joe Jimenez, promising help gaining access to Trump and influential officials in the new administration, according to an employee inside Novartis familiar with the matter. The extent to which Novartis conducted any due diligence into Cohen or his track record as a Trump insider and Washington player is uncertain. The meeting was a disappointment, the insider explained, and the Novartis squad left with the impression that Cohen and Essential Consultants - the firm controlled by Cohen that Novartis was making payments to - may not be able to deliver.

Week 2: Also no change in number of migraines/headaches, but the duration seems to be getting shorter (I'm tracking on an app). So far this week, I've been headache free (4 days now! I honestly can't remember the last time I've hit a streak this long!). So I'm pretty optimistic about this. The main difference I've noticed is I'm getting really dizzy at the onset of my migraines now. But like I said, they are much shorter. If anyone has any advice on getting rid of dizziness, I'm open to suggestions.",

I just want Aimovig to work and I'm at the point where I don't even care that I'll have to give myself the shots.

Here's my situation: I have headaches 100% of the time, but only a few \"migraines\" per month.  When I say migraines, I am talking about crippling migraine that puts me in bed with an icepack. I recently started getting Botox and my daily headaches have gotten a little better, and I have have had no \"migraines\" in weeks. I can deal with a few a migraines a month - which I don't even have anymore thanks to the botox. What I would fucking LOVE is to fix my daily headaches, but I never really hear any news about that because of the terminology that everyone uses.",

Some dizziness/ wibbly wobbley/ dropping things, but that isn't all that unusual for me since I'm generally in some state of pro or postdrome or active migraine. All that shit just seems to run together. TMI: Did not have my usual \"morning constitutional\" after, so got proactive (as I LOATHE even the slightest bit of constipation) and took a stimulant laxative. Things not moving as usual, but better. Taking another before I go to sleep. Will update with each dose. Good luck to all!",

The FDA is interested in reports of serious or new side effects, not reports of minor side effects that are mentioned in the prescribing information for the drug. If in doubt, I would say report it and they can sort it out. (For example, I would say that the vertigo some people experienced after the injection is something that should be reported.) Here is a link to more information about how to report. This is a totally new class of medication, not a \"me-too\" product, so it's super important that those of you who use it first are vigilant and report any problems. https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/ucm053074.htm",

The 2nd manufacturer hit some hiccups with their plant in S Korea (more of a political issue) nothing with the medicine itself. Should come out in Sept. then the third manufacturer in October, then the last will be December it that one is an IV. She said not a lot of data on the IV Interesting is that there isn't a difference in price between the 70 and the 140. If the prescribe the 140 you get 2 injectors. So she said she is sending in the Rx for the 140 for me!!  Wants me to do the 140 for a couple of months and if I start to really notice a difference then I can do the 70 but will get 2 injections for the price of one. Don't know if Amogen will fix that once the realize it. Let's hope not!  She was originally told it was going to be $50,000 a year, then $20,000 and last year $15,000 so she was happy about the price especially since I do Botox it is cheaper for me to do the CGRP. I am so excited and hope I get the medicine soon!! She also said many people reported being able to challenge themselves with their triggers and doing well with the medicine. For example I can't have any alcohol. It gives me an immediate migraine. So I am hoping in a few months I may be able to have a drink once in awhile!",

        "Comment": "I just came back from my 3 month follow up with my neurologist and he was actually the one who brought it up. He explained everything about it to me, I honestly haven't done much research on it, and he asked if I wanted to stick with what I'm currently taking (topiramate) or try aimovig. I decided to stick with topiramate, even though I'm still experiencing some tingling in my feet. Why did I choose to stick with topiramate? Truthfully, I'm a little nervous about sticking myself with something, though he swore it didn't hurt and it seems like others in this thread have said the same. But I'm also a little hesitant because of the claims of migraines being reduced ~only~ by 50% or more. Before I started topiramate I had anywhere between 17 and 20 days with a migraine. I've been on it for 3 months and this past month I've only had 3 migraines and their intensity was tolerable. So, I'm slightly nervous that if I start something new I'll revert back to having all those migraines and then what if for whatever reason I'm still getting 8-10 migraines a month? I have to go back to my neurologist in 6 months, so from now until then I plan on following this thread (please share your results!!) and other forums where people discuss aimovig to see everyone's progress and then take it from there. Only issue is that a month or so after my next appointment I will be without insurance so if I did want to switch I'm not exactly sure how I'd be able to pay for the medicine. So, like many people have said before, please continuing sharing all of your experiences!",

        "Comment": "I highly doubt this will be seen here, but per Mod direction, here goes: I got a call last week from the Aimovig Ally team, welcoming me to the trail program, etc. I specifically asked when my shot would arrive, and I was told since it was Thursday when they were calling, it probably wouldn't be sent until Monday because of overnight shipping weekend restrictions, blah blah whatever. Ok, fine. So that would have it arriving by Tuesday at the latest. Still nothing today, so I call and now the story has changed to - Oh, oops, we just got your information last week. The actual prescription wasn't processed until yesterday, and it will be at least another 24-48 hours before the pharmacy team calls to schedule my delivery. Which means it will be Thursday again, so we're back at shipping on Monday, arriving Tuesday, if I'm lucky. Maybe I'm just overly cranky about this whole situation, but my head is killing me today and I'm just so ready for any kind of relief. I was told originally from the time they got my paperwork from the doctor, I would have a shot in my hands in 3 business days. I just want to cry. Anyone else having shipping issues with the trial program?",

I currently do not take any preventive meds except for vitamins(magnesium, CoQ10 etc), and I do Botox. The Botox helped but not enough to justify the cost so I will probably stop that once I get the Aimovig. My friend is Austin got her Rx 4 days after me and already got a call about it! I am SO frustrated that it is taking this long!!",

They ordered the med and had it for me next day.  I paid for mine in full as my deductible hasn't been met yet.  It was $569 and change.  I was prescribed 140mg so two shots which i did both in my left thigh.  There is some hot swelling at one of the sites, but not bad.  I agree with others.  It stung while going in but nothing like Imitrex or Sumatriptan.  I feel a little woozy but I also took Rizatriptan an hour ago since today is not a good headache day.  I have daily chronic headache and have for as long as i can remember.  I had my first migraine when i was seven.  My doctor said that the studies were more for migraine relief than for chronic headache, but is hopeful that i will see results in the daily pain.  I never don't have a headache.  It just might be a good headache day or a bad one which will lead to a migraine if i don't attempt to stop it with ibuprofen, then Excedrin and then finally Rizatriptan as it progresses.  Looking forward to following this and hearing how everyone does!  Good luck getting your prescriptions filled and with feeling better!  Oh and btw, this is my first ever Reddit post :)",

I still haven't had a completely headache free day, but my headaches/migraines are less severe, I'm bouncing back quicker, and I'm experiencing more headache-free time each day. This has been subtle physically but has been pretty epic for me mentally. I cannot describe the joy and relief to be able to move through the world pain free even for just a little time each day and be able to focus and to be present. It makes me aware of how much of the time I have been just pushing through and the depths of the anxiety feedback loop living with migraine has created. I'm not free of either right now, but to feel the weight lighten is incredible. It occurred to me as I was saying this to a friend that there is a whole community of people who don't just know my physical pain, but know the mental anguish, the frustration, the constant exhaustion both from the mental and the physical, the anxiety of not drinking enough water or getting enough sleep or sitting next to some A#$hole with too much perfume. And I just want to say that you guys are amazing and strong and whether this drug works or some other drug, or a diet shift or acupuncture or anything, we all got to keep up hope. They say that people feel more effects in months two and three so I'll continue to update.  Much love y'all.",

        "Comment": "Alright so I read your other post and I gotta say that sounds like quite the change and I hope you get back to full. I will say that I got into fasting and stuff to work with that, you might have better luck with even one meal a day but there are diminishing returns to it and it can be kind of difficult getting all the calories in 3 or 4 hours. Ive personally been doing like 2 days of dry fasting every 2 weeks and some meal timing stuff which is easier than doing OMAD while still keeping me feeling OK when having lots of ice cream and like a gallon of milk. Just curious do you think the dairy thing was recent? I know one person I helped cure through here (granted it was their own pee) got dairy allergies I think after a few months or like a year or so of having at least liver flukes and maybe some other stuff, I think her family handled dairy fine though. As to sources for triclabendazole, I just used ebay -- it's sold for trematodes that can effect fish, but it should be the same (and of course only) drug used for them, and someone else said it worked great for him when I suggested it to him (a while ago on a different subreddit, but I'm fairly certain it was the same seller as there was probs only one on there. As to the urine, I would try to have it on an empty stomach for a few hours for a few days, which will be easier if you already do intermittent fasting. When you wake up it's the strongest. As to the sweet annie, I remember looking a fair bit online for sources, but the most I could find where oil pills, that were very expensive and probably only somewhat effective. If you have a local apothecary, you might have good luck there. Would probably work well in tangent with the urine, and something you could have as a mix of empty stomach + meals -- although you might need like 2 or 3 cups worth of tincture, over a few days. Preferably soften them up with urine if you go that path for a few days, to make it more reliable. Good luck. Keep us updated. Also, you say it mightve been from raw fish in spain? Are you sure you didnt have liver or some weird water?",

        "Comment": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) starts early, even in childhood.1,2 Non-invasive imaging in the PESA (Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis) study revealed that 71% and 43% of middle-aged men and women, respectively, have evidence of subclinical atherosclerosis.3 Extensive evidence from epidemiologic, genetic, and clinical intervention studies has indisputably shown that low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is causal in this process, as summarized in the first Consensus Statement on this topic.4 What are the key biological mechanisms, however, that underlie the central role of LDL in the complex pathophysiology of ASCVD, a chronic and multifaceted lifelong disease process, ultimately culminating in an atherothrombotic event? This second Consensus Statement on LDL causality discusses the established and newly emerging biology of ASCVD at the molecular, cellular, and tissue levels, with emphasis on integration of the central pathophysiological mechanisms. Key components of this integrative approach include consideration of factors that modulate the atherogenicity of LDL at the arterial wall and downstream effects exerted by LDL particles on the atherogenic process within arterial tissue.",

She\u2019s still a child, driven to the brink of madness and beyond by her experiences with the cult, including the experimentation and being sold off to a Brothel, so it probably brought out the protective instincts in a lot of them. The D G Cult is so horrific we know that thousands of children were kidnapped, enslaved and experimented upon, but only 3 of them are known to have survived. Given how Arianrhod treats Ennea (another survivor) like a daughter, and she\u2019s the big moral good of the society, I can see most of them having at least protective instincts over a girl who\u2019s still a child that\u2019s broken enough to only exist as an enforcer until someone finally is able to reach out.

Califf has deeper ties to the pharmaceutical industry than any FDA commissioner in recent history. He ran a multimillion-dollar clinical research center at Duke University that received more than 60 percent of its funding from the pharmaceutical and medical device industry. And his financial disclosure form last year listed seven drug companies and a device maker that paid him for consulting and six others \u2013 including Merck, Novartis and Eli Lilly \u2013 which supported his university salary.\" Pretty damming if you ask me.

Anyone have any resources or links they could direct me towards so that I could get more info on this subject? P.s., Yes. I did try various searches; however, and I found it interesting, but I didn't get a single relative hit regarding pharmaceutical deregulation in the US. Update: Changing my search engines yielded better results. Still, Bing yielded very little to no relevant results.  But, it is Bing.......",

Findings  In this cohort study of 255 infants born between March and December 2020, exposure to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection was not associated with differences on any Ages & Stages Questionnaire, 3rd Edition, subdomain at age 6 months, regardless of infection timing or severity. However, both exposed and unexposed infants born during that period had significantly lower scores on gross motor, fine motor, and personal-social subdomains compared with a historical cohort of infants born before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meaning  These findings suggest that birth during the COVID-19 pandemic, but not maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection, is associated with differences in neurodevelopment at age 6 months.",

        "Comment": "You are talking about what Novartis (maker of Cosentyx) calls their \"Covered until you're covered\" program. It is exactly what you say. Zero $$ from you for up to two years while receiving your Cosentyx directly from them. I was on this program for a few months while we worked with my insurance company to cover it. Worked flawlessly. Zero questions from them, other than \"what's your address?\" and \"do you have any allergies?\" When my dermatologist and I decided to go from Humira (working fairly well, but still had big flares occasionally) to Cosentyx, she made a call to Novartis and within 4 days I was taking my first loading doses. Now, Novartis won't do this if there isn't some high potential for upside to them. So their strategy is to get you to show improvement on their dime so your dermatologist has a compelling argument for your insurance carrier. Cosentyx has shown good success so far (not 100%, no biologic works for everyone) so they expect a high percentage of patients they help to get covered under insurance. Now, your insurance carrier surely knows about this program. They may drag it out a bit before covering you. I think the important thing is to work with your dermatologist / rheumatologist to communicate with the insurance company about what their threshold is for covering you. I know it's not really that simple. It probably is important to understand if they require a tiered approach (UVB, MTX, topicals) before going to biologics and if they'll bypass that if you show clearing with Cosentyx. Good luck. I have close to full clearing. I am 100% active again and my P isn't the first thing somebody sees when meeting me for the first time. EDIT: Wanted to add. Once you are covered under insurance, Novartis has their copay assistance program where they will cover up to $16,000 annually (from their website as of this morning) against your deductible and copays. This is quite generous and will cover most high deductible plans.",

Unfortunately if your insurance still denies you after two years then you\u2019re probably going to have to switch to something else, because it is quite expensive without insurance/copay assistance.",

        "Comment": "The key is \u201cfailure\u201d on previous medication, but it is important to know that failure does NOT mean that the previous medication had 0% success. It can mean several things: Example 1: patient tried methotrexate but had mild stomach upset. Example 2: Patient tries formulary approved biologic drug XYZ and gets 40% clearance but is still miserable. This is considered failure (because at least 90% could be possible with another drug, but don\u2019t know until it is tried) Example 3: patient tries formulary approved biologic XYZ and is getting results but is having terrible injection site reactions. This is considered failure. If you can get copay assistance to start the medication and report back to your doc that you\u2019re having great results in a couple of months, they should be able to resubmit the application for approval with your insurance company. It\u2019s harder for them to reject it when you\u2019re already on the medication and showing good results. I have personally experienced all of the \u201cfailures\u201d listed above in my 15 years of dealing with psoriatic arthritis and battling insurance companies, but a person need only experience one such event as evidence to move on to another drug. Even if drug XYZ was \u201csort of\u201d working, be honest with your doctor if you\u2019re still miserable. Make sure your experiences (including how psoriasis affects you emotionally/psychologically), all side effects and concerns are well documented in your records. And make sure your doctor is really making a good case to the insurance company versus just checking the boxes and submitting a generic approval form. Finding a doctor (and/or their staff... don\u2019t even get me started, lol), who will fight for you is half the battle. It takes time, but this approach has worked for me. I\u2019m on Taltz now and liking it so far. Hope Cosentyx works for you. Good luck!",

Bidens infrastructure spending bill will be a huge tailwind for CVX where over 100000 bridges alone in US are in desperate need of upgrade. Across Canada there are plenty for CVX In Ontario there are 96 bridges in need of repair and could use CVX s revolutionary cement technology. Highways roads and many other areas could use CVX cement technology. International cement giant Lafarge and few other giants are a customer of CVX and or have close associations with one another. Recently 2 institutions have started coverage with a buy recommendation and a target price of $1.25  CVX recently added that by moving some of their big contracts to 2022 they expect to have a revenue well over $30 to $40 mil At .385c CVX is extremely undervalued and perfect time to get in The recently done private placement at .65c has a strike price of .81c This means for institutions to cash their warrants they have to push the stock up to .81c to cash in their warrants So buying now you are easily make over 100%",

        "Comment": "GMOs themselves aren't harmful, the issue that the informed people have with them is the ecological impact of the pestisides that are sprayed on them. Most crops that are commercially farmed are genetically engineered to be resistant to glyphosate (Roundup). As of right now the USDA and FDA are saying glyphosate is safe. I'm not disagreeing with you that gmo farming is the best current method of farming, it uses less space and resources than traditional farming. Glyphosate can cause mutation to amphibious life forms and fish, it is literally in every food item in amounts that are concerning. So maybe a little bit here and there won't kill you, but a lifetime of microexposures could have the potential for medical complications. The more Roundup we use the more super weeds we spawn the more Roundup we need, this current form of pestiside use is not sustainable longterm. We need to be more responsible with this substance that has contaminated our entire food supply. Slightly unrelated, Monsanto Bayer has done nothing in their history as a company to gain the trust of the American people. They lied about the safety of many chemicals they have manufactured to keep selling them, PCBS, DDT, and Agent Orange. Why should we trust them about glyphosate when that is one of their top sellers?

We don't know the long-term consequences of consuming genetically modified organisms. You also have to understand that there are huge lobbying interests at play. The FDA, for example, is notorious for both its incompetence and corruption when it comes to approving foods that are dangerous. Here's an interesting real-life case. Cyclamates- they were marketed as an alternative to sugar for diabetics, and the company that tried to get its approval in foods had done its own shitty tests that would have been grounds for rejection. But instead the FDA went out of its way (you can probably guess why- money) to do its own tests (which indicated danger), and approved it. Decades later it was shown to cause a certain type of cancer.",

People refuse gmo crops because they are chemically doused with glyphosphate i.e round up., the same cancer causing chemical where Bayer is loosing court cases on and it will continue to loose, because people are dying from non-hodgkins lymphoma, cancer. If that's not bad enough the weeds are becoming  super resistant to round up to the point where it is no longer effective, search superweeds, nasty and can only be killed by hand, barely. These round up super weeds can bring a combine to a dead halt. And the farmers that can kill the super weeds, they have to use more and more round up to do it. which raises prices and exponentially increases soil and water toxicity. everyone suffers except Bayer and monsanto. To make matters worse for farmers, they can be sued if their neighbors crop pollinate their crop, and since the gmo seeds are patented, it is illegal to grow next year's crop from last year's seeds. which farmers have done since the being of agriculture, making farming even more expensive, which means your food prices go up even more. to summerize: gmo crops are bread to be resistant to cancer causing roundup that stays in foods even after washing. Monsanto can sue your neighbor if your gmo crops pollinate their field, and it is illegal to grow next year's crop with last year's seeds. The monoculture and round up destruction is highly unsustainable and we can see evidence of this yesterday, today and tomorrow. Sounds like a dystopian future to me. Chemical pesticides are destroying our land, and water supplies. They are literally killing people from the toxicity of cancer causing round up. Farming becomes more expensive, the food on your table get more expensive with no added benefit.",

And I dont just mean the ones whose fields get pollinated with the GMOs genetics by accident but anyone. Farmers own nothing now and are getting bullied by the companies who do GMO crops. Also GMO is very expensive and only marginally better than older hybrid breeding techniques. Some GMO plants are just made to be more resistant to pesticides and herbicides so that they can just have chemicals dumped on them. I'm not saying we shouldnt use pesticides and herbicides at all (that would be crazy) but we need to be encouraging better cultural farming practices that deter pests first and using those chemicals as a last resort. But instead we are just using them in excess as a primary pest  management just for good measure because is simpler. GMOs are facilitating that. And the same companies that produce GMOs are also selling those chemicals.nt Any technique that gives us better more resilient crops is a good thing definitely but they are being used by big business in a lot of unsavory ways.",

If anyone's interested, Ian Morris' \"Why The West Rules - For Now\" has a section dedicated to the domestication of previously wild grains. So anti-GMO can go swivel with it's backward nonsense.",

My criteria was that they must have increased their dividends between 2015 and 2019. I'm less fussed about 2020 but I'm staying away from industries that have taken a hit from covid. Just be wary of the FTSE 100 dinosaurs who offer good dividends but their markets are stagnating (oil, tobacco, big insurance). The UK has a lot of world leading mid-cap pharmaceuticals. There are also interesting companies like SONG that buys up the rights to music royalties from major musicians. I also like warehouse REITS like BBOX - they rent out behemoth warehouses to Amazon and the like and yield over 4% with quarterly payouts.",

        "Comment": "The best thing for Germans to be more keen on the EU Project is a better acting and performing EU. 3 Things happend that really pushed people here back: The failure of vaccine buying in Europe first, which cost many people their life. It is massively regarded as an dysfunctional EU failure, as the some countries in the EU pushed the block to pay low and not get what it could. Also the failure to sign most of the EU vaccines by Biontech, as nationalistic approaches by France, Sweden and other forced to sign contracts for vaccines that failed to perform well it be produced enough. The post covid economy fond. Germany stands for like 170 Billion of that Bill, gets around 30 Billion back. The audacity to tell the Germans what to do with that money the debt is five times over they sum getting back really rubbed some nerves. The entire thing is highly unliked here because transfers of money or guarantees for other states debt are factual forbidden and extremely unpopular.  But when you become the biggest financer and get told what you have to do with the cents you get back, people really grinded their gears. The constant EU powergrab: The Bundesverfasssungsgericht (German Constitutional Court, highest court we have) is the most well regarded public institution, far above parliament or chancellor. That they are fought so heavily now by the powergrabers, who constantly go above and beyond the contracts, is pretty much by nobody well received. Especially because the ruling that sparked it, was received as mild and a golden olive branch, as it did not stop anything or threw a wrench into a questionable state finance program. It just asked for information and that was it. Then there is now the powergrab in digital media. The EU has no regulation in digital media outside of the outdated 20 years old e commerce guideline. It constantly failed to regulate and watched hoe Ireland and others dodged to regulation. Now Germany starts it's regulation and what comes out of it? Brussels goes aggressive and threatens to block it, because it might conflict with a non existing regulation, that might come 2022. A regulation that Brussels promised would not interfere with national regulations. Jokesters. The last year just has been a very weak performance by the eu governance. Covid, Hungary and Poland, refuges, no matter the problem, the eu looked weak. And it took a toll. If they want to turn it around, they don't need German politicians to speak new speak about the EU. They just need to perform better.",

But now we have to follow Brussels' rules :( This sadly used to work, because national media ignores EU institutions mostly. It also works on a lot of people that only read news, but none of the political magazines (that take time to drill into issues, and not only report 'fresh').

Eastern European countries deciding that going back 500 years is the best choice (or even becoming more and more foreign agents within the EU, see Hungary), the drama about the transfer of finances towards mainly Southern Europe who haven't even used prior funds properly or fully in the past, all the time while the EU cannot move forward because we need all States to agree on everything... I don't know, it just has been leaving me more frustrated than ever. Also the comments calling for Germany to take a more central role in the EU are kind of amusing. Hasn't Merkel done just that in the last years and caused huge outcry over it? Be it the case with Covid or with Greece in the past (where some people still seem to blame Germany for all its problems, which I find odd). Whenver Germany has an answer that isn't an easy one, everyone seems to tell us to bugger off. Kind of a weird paradox where people want Germany to lead, but only in a way they approve.",

The young are hardly better. They live in this delusion that Germany is supporting the rest of lazy europe while they gain nothing. I think the vaccine blunders and the recent failure of their catastrophe warning system may have deflated them a bit, but underneath their apparent modesty and politeness it is still \"deutschland \u00fcber alles in der welt\".",

This new high cost is the result of the healthcare proclamation that Trump tried to pass, which has been temporarily blocked, but until when is unknown. Currently and  without the healthcare proclamation being passed the healthcare would have cost a lot less, at $400 each a month.. This new order doesn\u2019t allow new (tax paying and working) immigrants to use healthcare credits within the health care marketplace. In the UK as an immigrant  you pay \u00a3200 a year for unlimited free care (called a surcharge) each year your visa is valid until you become a citizen. Yeah, you may wait in line a little longer and the hospitals may not be shiny and seem gloomy in comparison, but thats because they don\u2019t profit from the people\u2019s misery and grief.  The staff are just as professional and dedicated to helping their patients just as they are anywhere in the world. Just thought I\u2019d share my personal and real experience as I have had the pleasure of dealing with both US and UK healthcare.",

        "Comment": "Well I'm a bit late here, but first, thanks for typing up such a detailed review. Let me respond to what I think is the key point here: Simply put, Sen no Kiseki is a good JRPG game, but only a decent Kiseki entry. So much more could\u2019ve been done to it, and so much didn\u2019t need to be removed and then carelessly replaced through the transition from Ao. I\u2019m so critical of it not because I want to hate it, but because I know it could have been far more. After Zero and Ao showed me how far Falcom can go with their storytelling, I am not convinced that this is the best they can do. The Crossbell arc is my favourite part of the series so far, and Cold Steel my least favourite. But to be fair, Falcom set themselves a hard task for Cold Steel: making an \"entry point\" to attract new players and introduce them to the massive world of Trails, without boring old players. So the writers bundled up the huge amounts of knowledge they needed to convey into a rigid structure. Each character represented/personified one facet of the world, and each chapter explores some facets of the world through the corresponding characters' back-stories. That way, the \"Zemuria for Dummies\" material isn't totally repetitive for returning players: the specific details of the characters are still new to you even if the background knowledge isn't. The result wasn't amazing, but it was a hard balance to strike. Zero and Sky FC never had to balance those two disparate goals. Sky FC could focus solely on introducing Zemuria, without worrying about returning players. And Zero was not an \"entry point\": it could have a great complicated story & system because players are expected to know a lot about the world already - bracers, orbments, sepith, Erebonian Empire, Ouroboros, Joshua & Estelle & who they're pursuing, etc. IMO Cold Steel II was the bigger disappointment: it was marginally better than the first game, but it really should have been leaps & bounds better, because Falcom weren't facing any of the limitations of an \"entry point\" game. In particular II had no excuse for its formulaic, repetitive chapter structure. Some comments on specific details: I liked the new fishing system better. Never got the hang of the old-style fishing with no visual indicator whatsoever, just pressing a button at the beep. IIRC the CP 0 and instant death \"anti-bonuses\" first appeared in Sky 3rd, and also show up in the Crossbell arc in the dungeons where higher elements are active, so this one's not really Cold Steel's fault. Arcus and lack of Orbment lines - Akatsuki brings back Enigma II , probably because UserJoy has figured out that's what fans want. And floor tile highlights on the battlefield too ( see the new video ) Re: \"And that brings us to one of the final dungeon\u2019s main attractions, Sen spoiler\", well, Crossbell also gave us Ao spoiler Crossing the Nord Highlands a few times by horse was nowhere near as painful as that stupid shoe-testing quest in Sky FC",

Blocking the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in vitro completely abolished the suppression of T-cell proliferation by MSCs and restored T-cell expression of CD25 as well as responsiveness to interleukin-2. In vivo, administration of MSCs significantly reduced delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to allogeneic antigen and profoundly prolonged the survival of fully allogeneic islet grafts in transplant recipients. Significantly, these MSC-mediated protective effects were completely reversed by in vivo inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9.

        "Comment": "Multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs) are adult adherent stromal stem cells currently being assessed in clinical trials for acute graft versus host disease with demonstrated immunomodulatory capabilities and the potential to ameliorate detrimental autoimmune and inflammation-related processes. Anti-CD3/anti-CD28 (3/28) activation of T cells within the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) compartment was performed in the presence or absence of MAPCs. Liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry was used to characterize the differential secretion of proteins, and transcriptional profiling was used to monitor mRNA expression changes in both cell populations. Overall, 239 secreted and/or ectodomain-shed proteins were detected in the secretomes of PBMCs and MAPCs. In addition, 3/28 activation of PBMCs induced differential expression of 2,925 genes, and 22% of these transcripts were differentially expressed on exposure to MAPCs in Transwell. MAPCs exposed to 3/28-activated PBMCs showed differential expression of 1,247 MAPC genes. Crosstalk was demonstrated by reciprocal transcriptional regulation. Secretome proteins and transcriptional signatures were used to predict molecular activities by which MAPCs could dampen local and systemic inflammatory responses. These data support the hypothesis that MAPCs block PBMC proliferation via cell cycle arrest coupled to metabolic stress in the form of tryptophan depletion, resulting in GCN2 kinase activation, downstream signaling, and inhibition of cyclin D1 translation. These data also provide a plausible explanation for the immune privilege reported with administration of donor MAPCs.   .......   SIGNIFICANCE: This study documents experiments quantifying solution-phase crosstalk between multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The secretome and transcriptional changes quantified suggest mechanisms by which MAPCs are hypothesized to provide both local and systemic immunoregulation of inflammation. The potential impact of these studies includes development of a robust experimental framework to be used for preclinical evaluation of the specific mechanisms by which beneficial effects are obtained after treatment of patients with MAPCs.    ....this from  ..... http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26494783",

        "Comment": "-------munological characteristics of human mesenchymal stem cells and multipotent adult progenitor cells------------------  The extensive proliferation potential of hMAPCs allows banking of large amounts of cells for their clinical use. Moreover, the immunomodulatory properties of hMAPCs make it possible to use them as a universal donor. Therefore, a clinical grade, large-scale expanded product has been developed based on the MAPC technology (Multistem). Genomic and epigenetic stability of Multistem during long-term culture expansion has been confirmed, and preclinical studies demonstrated the safety of administration in repeat dosing regimens in BM transplant settings    ....  Last year (2012), clinical results from the phase I trial in acute myocardial infarction demonstrated the safety of Multistem. Moreover, a beneficial effect was seen, in part, because of their ability to induce neovascularization through secretion of trophic factors such as VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), IL8 and CXCL5 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 5).96, 97 Earlier this year(2013), the results of the phase I trial for the prevention of GVHD were announced. Single dose and repeat dose administration of MultiStem was well-tolerated, and a low incidence of severe acute GVHD was observed.    .....      this from  ... http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3540326/",

        "Comment": "Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are rare progenitor cells present in adult bone marrow that have the capacity to differentiate into a variety of tissue types, including bone, cartilage, tendon, fat, and muscle. In addition to multilineage differentiation capacity, MSCs regulate immune and inflammatory responses, providing therapeutic potential for treating diseases characterized by the presence of an inflammatory component. The availability of bone marrow and the ability to isolate and expand hMSCs ex vivo make these cells an attractive candidate for drug development. The low immunogenicity of these cells suggests that hMSCs can be transplanted universally without matching between donors and recipients. MSCs universality, along with the ability to manufacture and store these cells long-term, present a unique opportunity to produce an \"off-the-shelf\" cellular drug ready for treatment of diseases in acute settings. Accumulated animal and human data support MSC therapeutic potential for inflammatory diseases. Several phase III clinical trials for treatment of acute Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) and Crohn's disease are currently in progress. The current understanding of cellular and molecular targets underlying the mechanisms of MSCs action in inflammatory settings as well as clinical experience with hMSCs is summarized in this review.    ..... http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19530993",

If you look at a list of Finnish municipalities by population you'll see that Helsinki is by far the biggest (650k), followed by 5 cities in the 200k-300k region: Espoo, Tampere, Vantaa, Oulu, and Turku. Espoo and Vantaa I rule out, because they're in the Helsinki metro area, grown into it. Combined the capital region has a population of a little over 1 million, you generally think of it as one unit. It's kinda like San Francisco-Oakland-San Jos\u00e9, three large cities grown into one megacity. Though if the Bay Area is a megacity, the capital region in Finland is a kilocity at most. That leaves out Tampere, Oulu, and Turku. I'd argue that Tampere has the best case for being the 2nd city, since the Tampere region is the 2nd largest metro area in Finland with a population of roughly 400 000 people, but Turku has a pretty good case for itself too, due to it being a more historically significant city. Oulu is larger than Turku, but it's so far north that for people like me who live in the southern parts of the country it doesn't really pass my mind too often. So I guess the answer is no, Finland doesn't have a prominent third city. I'd say that the capital region is the city no. 1, Tampere is 2A, Turku is 2B and Oulu either 2C or 3, whatever you want.",

        "Comment": "We have Izmir with 4.3 million population. It doesn't fit into your description. It was historically the most important city after Istanbul, and used to be the 2nd city until few decades before. The secular culture and mild climate of Izmir attracts more people every year. 2020 was the first year when Istanbul lost population. While, Izmir became the city with highest immigration. (That's what I remember, maybe I'm wrong on some details.) Istanbul dominates the country in all aspects with its 15 million population. People critize the focus on Istanbul while the other big cities are ignored. Ankara (5.6 million), Izmir and Bursa (3.1 million) are notable cities outside the Istanbul. As I know, Istanbul and Ankara have more job opportunities than Izmir. At least in my career, architecture. Bursa is the major industrial powerhouse and does not fit into your the description either. (but I know nothing much about it to give details) Also, there are other 5 cities larger than 2 million population in Turkey. They are more regional as your description. This number increases to 20 if we look at 1M+ population. Some of them are just really ordinary cities. That's why, it was always surprising to see many important European cities with 1 or 2 million population.",

The battle for 2nd and 3rd is then between the next two settlements, Akureyri and Keflav\u00edk. Both are similar sized but Akureyri usually takes this crown being a beautiful town with a unique sense of identity, a popular destination for locals and tourists alike and a vital service centre for the whole of northern Iceland. (Totally not biased in any way) That leaves Keflav\u00edk as the third city. It's undeniably bigger than the remaining towns, but its home to the airport... and not an awful lot else. Not to mention it has something of \"reputation\" to many Icelanders. It's the place you drive past on the way to/from the airport but you rarely if ever stop there.",

        "Comment": "For the UK as a whole, London and Edinburgh are the two most important by virtue of being capitals. For the third, I\u2019d say Manchester, followed very closely by Glasgow. Manchester makes up the centre of the Northern Powerhouse, the industrial-economic spine of northern England and the Midlands, as well as a keystone between England and Scotland. Meanwhile, Edinburgh may be the brain of Scotland, but Glasgow is the heart - the most heavily populated, most central, and most culturally influential. I\u2019m putting it just behind Manchester purely because it doesn\u2019t connect to the rest of the country in the same way - as a city in itself, Glasgow beats Manchester. If we\u2019re talking about just England, I\u2019d say Leeds-Bradford followed by Birmingham. Leeds is the (informal) capital of Yorkshire, a comparatively vast region of England with frankly immense industrial power; but it also holds most of the north\u2019s media and cultural influence, especially when combined with Bradford. Birmingham, meanwhile, is England\u2019s second-most populous city, and the centre of the English Midlands. I\u2019m placing it behind Leeds-Bradford because the latter has influence over the whole north, while Birmingham influences a smaller area, and has less economic power.",
