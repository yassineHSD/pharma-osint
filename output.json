Their pain therapy is probably a small part of their overall portfolio They\u2019ve recently had some drawbacks with their wet AMD compound, and I\u2019m pretty sure zolgensma isn\u2019t doing as well as they hoped. I think it still will break the 1 bill mark, but I am not sure what their future plans for additional gene therapy products are",

        "Comment": "There's a page on Factions in the Codex Arcana, but the actual spells and items you can craft don't show up until you're at the Tier where you can access them, and by then you've already picked a faction, so I'll list them here. Fey: Mushroom Soldiers and Pixies will now aid you in combat, although the allies of other factions will now attack you. Can craft the Bracelet of Trickery at Tier 3, which turns you invisible and makes your unarmed punch deal knockback as long as you are sneaking.  You also unlock the following spells: Briarthorne Barrier (immune to things like cactus), Confuse (makes mobs hostile to nearest mob/player), and Decoy (create an illusion copy of yourself to draw mob aggro). Can craft the Spectral Elytra at Tier 5, which is basically a mana-fueled elytra with hypothetical infinite flight.  You also unlock the spells Heal (gain HP) and Greater Invisibility (invisibility that affects armor and held items). Wizard: Spellbreakers and Witch Hunters will now aid you in combat, although the allies of other factions will now attack you. Can craft the Ley Line Bracelet at Tier 3, which recharges your mana faster near ley lines (visible with a special ointment they also unlock at this tier).  You also unlock the Arcane Damage spell (deals damage and drains mana from victim). At Tier 4 you unlock the Animus spell (animates blocks to attack enemies for you). Can craft the Arcane Crown at Tier 5, which gives you bonus mana and occasionally clears debuffs.  You also unlock the spells Mana Shield (protects you from incoming damage) and Mana Transfer (gives some of your mana to the target). Demon: Imps and Lantern Wraiths will now aid you in combat, although the allies of other factions will now attack you. Can craft the Emberglow Bracelet at Tier 3, which gives fire immunity while worn. At Tier 4 you unlock the spells Cauterize (take a little damage and gain regen), Explosion (obvious), and Nethergate (teleport between overworld and nether). Can craft the Hellfire Staff at Tier 5, which buffs the damage, radius, range, and burn duration of fire-themed spells.  It also makes your flames green when igniting or damaging things.  Spells unlocked are Absorption (like a golden apple), Fire Shield (burns mobs in melee range), and Life Tap (affected creatures grant you health when you hurt them). Also, make sure you have the correct mote in your hand when you summon the faction (air for Fey, arcane for Wizard, fire for Demon).  For the Demon, you also need to make sure to bring some form of fire protection or healing, as you will be on fire for the duration of the ritual.",

When the market recovered a month after his sources said it was gonna happen, he made it sound like his sources got it right, to the day\u2026\u2026 so much for his 120k end of year Bitcoin guarantee. \u201cSources\u201d lol.

If you want something easier to access then Odysee uses Library\u2019s whole system but provides a bit better interface through the web. If you really wanna stick it to YouTube then use those to watch creators that have moved over. I think there\u2019s even an extension to tel you if a creator uploaded on Odysee too. The more people do that the more creators see it as a viable option and the more likely it is for YouTube to have to adapt or die. They\u2019ve obviously grown too big and can/will make changes or govern itself on its own accord. Plus you get tokens just for using Library or Odysee with an address/account attached. (Tokens you can sell OR use to contribute to creators directly)",

I would hope people aren't so short sighted as to not see how this will be abused to no end, but then again I am used to disappointment. In 10 years the same people cheering this will be crying and calling it an invasion of their privacy when they find you that they're on \"the list\". Imagine if this same exact thing, had been proposed in 2017, under Donald Trump. How would you feel about it then? How would you feel about Donald Trump starting up this exact same program against say Antifa? And you can bet Antifa WILL be on this list. If you don't like this in 2017 with Donald Trump at the helm, you should not like it now.",

(I'm a bot) T. he curious relationship between one of the world's biggest drug makers and President Trump's personal lawyer began early last year when Michael Cohen, a longtime fixer for the president, reached out to Novartis's then-chief executive officer Joe Jimenez, promising help gaining access to Trump and influential officials in the new administration, according to an employee inside Novartis familiar with the matter. The extent to which Novartis conducted any due diligence into Cohen or his track record as a Trump insider and Washington player is uncertain. The meeting was a disappointment, the insider explained, and the Novartis squad left with the impression that Cohen and Essential Consultants - the firm controlled by Cohen that Novartis was making payments to - may not be able to deliver.

Eugen Schwab was director of the factory of the Swiss company Escher Wyss in Ravensburg when Klaus Schwab was born in 1938. The family was privileged. They say director, but I see elsewhere he was described as commercial director. And the company was probably a subsidiary of Escher Wyss called Andritz: https://www.andritz.com/hydro-en/about-andritz-hydro/locations/ravensburg-germany Eugen was also \"President of the Upper Swabian Chamber of Industry and Commerce\"... https://www.zvab.com/1867-1967-100-Jahre-Oberschw%C3%A4bische-Industrie-/465143460/bd ...if the date of publication of that book fits, which it would appear to, and there weren't any other prominent Eugen Schwab's in the area at that time.",

No matter how complex the lore may get at times, or how long we have to go between content, I always get excited to see new stuff relating to FNaF. Even ignoring the games themselves, you as a person have continuously inspired me. You've always been very passionate about the fanbase as well as the games themselves, you've been respectful to everyone, you put so much care and effort into every project, and you've overall always just been a very good, kind person. You don't deserve any of this unnecessary drama at all. What you do is ultimately up to you, but don't let Twitter scare you. Me as well as hundreds of thousands of other people will always love and appreciate you. I don't know how to put into words how much good you've done for millions of people. I wish the best for you and your family, take care.",

I really hope you don\u2019t leave the community, it would be so weird without you. I may not agree with your political opinions, but what you did is perfectly acceptable, and I don\u2019t know why everyone\u2019s making a big fuss over it. When I saw the ending to The Desolate Hope, I didn\u2019t see it as anti-abortion. What I saw it as was a message to those who died too young, or for those who had to grow up too quickly. I\u2019m sorry everyone is making a big fuss over this, and I know there will always be fans who support you, and that group includes me. Sincerely, Cherri",

Besides, most things that people can take from you are things that never had much value to begin with.\" This is what the haters have been missing this entire time. You don't do it for the money, and that's what makes you, well, you! No other person making a game is as supportive as you are. Yes you some times make mistakes but that's what makes you human. I'm tired of living in a world that once you make a mistake it ruins your life forever. Scott, if you're reading this (which I doubt) Stay with us. You really are an amazing person, even if people don't agree with you on the political compass. We now know you supported these people because you thought they were doing their best. You don't see the bad in people. Which makes you lovable. You never really got into politics. You, a father, should not be afraid of people trying to break into your house. I have been a fan since day 1, and I never thought this would happen in a million years. But, that's just how things are now. We didn't know the reason why you donated to these people and people were already sending threats. I wish you the best",

However, a lifetime of pain levied upon me by my Christian upbringing has led me to feel quite hurt by this. I have nothing against God or Christ. What I do have a problem with is the way that American Christian culture blends Christianity with un-Christian political views and unrelated American culture. Growing up, I felt different. I tried to give my life to God, but I was never doing it \u201ccorrectly\u201d according to my church and school. Loving God was never enough. I had to love God while being unadulteratedly patriotic, manly, and conservative. This was never said out loud, but it was communicated in other ways. When I saw the way that Trump treated the least of these, it disgusted me. When I tried to speak up about it, the culture won. My Christian friends and family slowly pushed me out, and I realized that it was never just about God. When I see people donate to Trump or the GOP, all I can remember is the pain. And seeing one of my favorite game creators of all time donate to him still made me hurt, even if that donation isn\u2019t directly tied to an ideological stance. What happened to you is awful and I\u2019m truly sorry. But as long as that culture continues to gatekeep and judge the people who have been sorely deprived of love, I\u2019m not sure I can take supporting it to mean anything else. Best of luck, Scott. Sorry people were so awful to you.",

I honestly don't think he deserves to be cancelled after all of the good things he's done this isn't even bad he had good intentions but they were twisted by twitter of course. Please, stay safe Scott.",

For all of this to be piled onto you while your wife is pregnant, congratulations by the way you must be stressed as all heck. I suggest taking a little holiday as it's the summer, places are beginning to open up and you could bring a laptop or something to keep an eye on Security Breach. It might help take the stress off your wife too. In my opinion, Cancellers are like the digital incarnation of Karens. They see one thing that somebody says or does that they don't agree with and immediately jump onto it. Pair that with the fact that nowadays it's so much easier to connect with other people online and the fact that internet access is just so common now, and you have a force to be aware of. They jump onto issues every time they're discovered and most of the time, the victims don't respond as far as I know. So making a stand is a good move. Retiring is your choice and only yours. Don't let other people push/force you to make that decision. If you do decide to retire, then it's been a fun, wild, and sometimes inspiring run. Thank you.",

Ever. But some do have a point in saying they're upset that Scott made these donations to political figures that actively work against their right to exist. Scott said he himself isn't supportive of anti-LGBT or racism, sexism etc, but there's also the fact he still supported sexist, homophobic and racist people. The Racism, Sexism and Homophobia weren't deal breakers. Depending on when he donated, he could look past the fact that the person he supported incited a riot based on a lie about the presidential vote. Thats the issue so many people have, the major issues weren't major enough to Scott to make him vote someone else. This is hurtful, especially since I myself am Gay. I still love the series and am excited for SB, and will probably continue to support the series. Been here since Markiplier's first play through so I have a close connection with the series . One thing I think people often forget is that nobody is black and white. Nobody is purely awful or purely good, at least rarely.  While Scott donated to some awful people, he also donated so much to St Jude's. End of the day he's just another man, trying to find the best way to live in the world. Of course he will make mistakes EDIT : Spelling and grammar",

I 100% think Scott didn't know that they were against LGBTQ community at the time he was only donating for the good part of them not the part of removing LGBTQ rights. Also this donation was so long ago that Scott probably forgotten about donating to them. I am apart of the community. I am bisexual, but I know that Scott donated to them with good intentions. Scott always has good intentions and isn't a bad person he is an angel. The amount of money he has given away is spectacular. the amount of children he has visited for their final wishes. Why are we looking at somthing that was done so long ago we are looking at somthing so minuscule. but we aren't looking at what he has done good like donate hundreds of thousands of dollars to charity.",

You and your family do not deserve to be stalked, doxxed, harassed, or threatened for your political beliefs. That being said, I don't disagree with the many people who are concerned by some of the politicians you've donated to. There are some genuinely terrible people on that list, with many concerning views and policies, and I don't blame the people who are upset to see that. Those under the LGBT flag, especially. I think it's fair to be concerned and feel betrayed. I dont think youre a bad person, Scott. I know you've done a lot of good for charities, employed multiple highly diverse people, advocated for minorities, etc. I also dont think you should be lambasted or lose everything for your beliefs. You've shown time and time again that you care for so many people, and I will never deny that. With all that, I have to say that I'm highly conflicted with everything. I really don't know how to feel. This situation is messy, complicated, and incredibly unfortunate. I hope you and your family remain safe, and I wish the best to you and your wife. I know that a pregnancy can be a tumultuous time to begin with, but having this added stress can't be helpful. I don't know whether or not I'll continue purchasing the games in the series, as I sincerely don't want to inadvertently fund people who I feel want to harm myself and people close to me. I hope everyone can remain civil and understand that this isn't as black and white as some would like to make it out to be. Scott, I hope you can understand the depths of people's concern. I hope you can see through the unreasonable hatred and absolutely disgusting conduct of some, and read the valid concerns people have with who you've sent substantial amounts of money to. There's a good reason for people to be upset, and you voting red isn't all this boils down to and I hope you can see that despite the irrationality you've been met with.",

Even if I don\u2019t personally agree, I don\u2019t care because I still know you\u2019re a great guy who\u2019s done so much for the community and so many other people My only problem was with the donations themselves. I mean no offense, but you donated to a billionaire that hasn\u2019t shown all that much care for about 4 and a half percent of the US population, a lot of which are likely in this fandom. Again I don\u2019t care who you vote for or what you align with, and I don\u2019t know why I feel this way, but I guess by supporting you, in a twisted way, it almost feels like I\u2019m supporting them? I know that\u2019s not how it works but I can\u2019t get that thought out of my head and it bothers me What I\u2019m trying to say is I want to support you, not some rich guy, and I wish you the best, because you don\u2019t deserve the situation you\u2019re in right now at all Edit - Also congrats on the new Fnaf playtester kid!",

I will probably continue to enjoy fnaf as I have for many years, but I will be rethinking how and when I choose to spend money on this franchise or buying games directly. While I agree we can all have different opinions; I think most people's problem with it was that they knew money they were supplying to this brand would potentially now knowingly be going to a party that has worked consistently to discriminate against and keep down marginalized people. It is pride month. Right now republicans of all different backgrounds and states are trying to implement policies that would greatly harm trans kids, and I think that regardless of how nice or well thought out a person's explanation is, I can't personally consent to see my money potentially go to those causes. I wish Scott a safe and comfortable life, but as a trans person and as someone who speaks with my dollar, I think my future money would be better spent amongst the fans who create, or going directly to donations. Scott can choose to put his money where he likes, as can I. I'm not sure what this will mean for Security Breach as it was the first FNAF game I was anticipating buying and playing on my own. I think at this point I am going to be more comfortable just watching a ytber play it, but maybe this will change. Just my two cents.",

You saved many lives without really knowing it, whether it be financially, emotionally, school-related, and so on. You inspired so many of us with your work. Thanks to you, I found an amazing hobby, I found amazing friends, even more, and loving followers of my work and channel. You revolutionized a part of the horror genre. May people say what they want, objectively FNaF did reinvent a part of the horror genre. Politics didn't have to be involved in there. THIS shouldn't have been shown AT ALL. Whether you be republican, democrat, you had the intelligence to never show your political opinion in here, and thank you for that, I wish more people would do that because either many of us don't care about politics, are traumatized by politics (do i need to give an example) or are too young to even understand (don't worry, even for us young adults it's hard to understand...). The ones who leaked your donations aren't even part of the fandom, they just did this to fuck around. Well, sorry for what I'm about to say, but fuck them. Hard. If it's your last post, may you take a great rest from this. I do hope that everything will get better for you, your wife, your children and soon-to-be newborn.",

Me personally do not care if you're Republican or a Trump supporter. The reason why people are mad is because you're donating thousands of dollars to politicians who are trying to limit/remove rights from the LGBTQ+ community. I understand that you support those politicians mostly for their other views, but you're still contributing to the problem. If you do care about the lives of ALL human beings, then why not donate money to the LGBTQ+ community? I think that is fair considering you donated money to anti-LGBT politicians. I wish you and your family a safe and happy life. Take care. God bless you.",

Seeing all these people claim you\u2019d believe all these things just because of who you\u2019ve given money to was heart breaking. I couldn\u2019t believe such nasty things were being said about you before you\u2019d had a chance to react. I can only imagine how scary it must have been for you and your family to get death threats from random strangers who may have obtained your home address. I hope that you can all mentally recover from this event. I\u2019m sorry that so many people jumped to conclusions. I tried my best to use my voice on Twitter through FNAF Alerts to tell people not to assume such rash things, but the platform is a beast nobody can tame. I knew that none of what they were saying was true, and I knew it was your right as an American to support whatever politicians you believed were best for this country. As someone I look up to, I actually did a school project about your life and what lead to your success, and I knew from that research that you were not someone who would be so discriminatory. I of course had doubts, everyone did, but I held on to my faith in you, and I\u2019m so relieved to know I was right to do so. Thank you for this response, I\u2019m sure it was difficult to write. I will keep supporting your work as much as possible by continuing to expand my never ending collection of merchandise. Thank you for being, like, the most awesome person in the world. And also, big congratulations on the pregnancy, and early congratulations for seven years of Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s.",

I'm also bisexual, and a transgender man, the experiences and things I learned being queer are a big part of who I am, I would be a really different person if I were cishet. I don't want to make this about you being christian, republican and/or pro-life, I really don't want to, but I guess its going to be interpreted as that. I do not approve in any way the doxxing, its objectively shitty and in bad taste. I also do not support the fact that somebody just went up to dig the donations, but at the same time it feels so shitty to see you donating so much to charity, being the \"dad\" of this fandom, only to find out that behind doors you were also donating to politicians that want to take the rights of my community away. I understand that you did it for the economy, I understand that you never wished any ill intention on us, I understand that you were only using your liberty, but I also need you to understand that the anti-lgbt decisions of those politicians affect us in every aspect of our lives, and that by donating money to them it only helps them to continue those anti-lgbt decisions. If the politicians were democrats instead of republicans, this would still be my reaction. I do not think you're a transphobe, a homophobe or something like that, but please, understand why a lot of us feels afraid, hurt, betrayed and angry. Its not about side teams, its about our lifes. To see somebody we looked up and cared, directly funding those who treat us like a plague. Edit: Sorry about the edits, I'm not really good expressing myself with words",

You've been a role model to me for the past 7 years of my life, and I'm happy to say you still are. The fact that don't surrender to a bunch of people online is something not a lot of people would do, and that's admirable, to me. The threats they have sent you and your family are appalling, and the fact that they doxxed you is too much for anybody to be deserving of, regardless of what they've done. You didn't deserve this. Cancel culture really is the worst. I really appreciate everything you have done for this community, and for the world in general. Even if you don't post here again, or hell, even if you choose to retire, I will always remember you for the strong person you are.

This isn't a spot for political warfare, this is a spot for Five Nights at Freddy's, something that has brought people like me absolute joy, creativity, friends, and the like, and I will forever be grateful for FNaF and what it did for me. It has gotten me through tough times, it got me into collecting, it got me into things that have a deeper story, it got me into creating art, it gave me happiness when nothing else did, hell, it's become my biggest special interest/thing to hyperfocus on and I bet tons of other people, no matter who they are or even what they believe in, can say the same thing. No matter what happens, we are going to stick around, and we understand that you have a heart of gold, one that is purely unbeatable, and one that can be seen as an inspiration. I have nothing but massive respect for you Scott, I really do, and I don't want to even think about what life would have been if I never got into FNaF and if I never got to bear witness to one of the best people ever.

I believe you when you say you believe in every form of equality, but that still doesn\u2019t dismiss the fact that you donated to campaigns and people who want a certain group of people dead. And for those who say this is an exaggeration, it isn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re intentions are good. The unfortunate truth of the matter is, your intentions will never affect the way your donation will be spent. Indirect support is still that, support. I am not apart of the LGBTQA+ community myself, but I do have friends who are. Friends who have been affected by these injustices towards them. It honestly infuriates me that people are just willing to go \u201cIt\u2019s fine Scott, you\u2019re still my hero\u201d. You fail to realise the consequences his donations have. He may have donated the money with good intentions, but that does not dismiss the fact that that money still went to a dangerously harmful campaign to get rid of a certain group of people\u2019s rights. I don\u2019t hate you Scott, I rlly don\u2019t. I\u2019m glad that you were honest here, I\u2019m so glad you aren\u2019t the person people accused you of being, and I\u2019m so damn mad at the people who threatened you and your family\u2019s well being and wish you, your wife, and your kids nothing but the best. But please, do some research, educate yourself further of the campaigns and people you donate to. Your abundance of good deeds are never lost upon me and everyone else. All I ask is for you to be informed and see the true colors of the people you think are doing good for your country. And too everyone who jumped the gun and called him homophobic, transphobic, racist on Twitter: Stop living in that fucking bubble of yours where everything is all black and white. It isn\u2019t. Situations have complicated nuances to them, it isn\u2019t just \u201cGood or bad\u201d. Also, to the people who are calling out other people who are now uncomfortable spending money on the FNaF franchise: Please understand that it comes from a place of feeling uncomfortable giving money to a man who they think might just give it to the campaigns. It may not be the whole truth, but please respect them on that end either way. Also, never discredit the voices of the LGBTQA+ people who speak out against this. They have every right to be upset and mad about the situation.",

        "Comment": "Let me preface this by saying that the doxxing and death threats were completely unacceptable. I know a lot of people won't bother to read this if I don't start with that, especially since this is gonna be a lot. But Scott, you have to understand this: even if you supported these people for other reasons, you have to come to terms with the fact that you can't just pick and choose which parts of their platforms you support. Even if you only agree with one part of what they say, by supporting them, especially financially, you're supporting everything they stand for. The money you give them doesn't care why you're giving it to them. That money is going to be used for everything they stand for, including the parts that involve directly harming people. You need to understand that this is why people are upset. You can't say \"even if there were others who had better things to say about the LGBT community, but I felt they may have in actuality done more harm than good\" when the people you supported have actively and openly stated their stance is antagonistic. Choosing someone who is open about their hatred is not, in any circumstance, a better option than someone who says they will support but might do more harm than good. That's just not how this works. For everyone who's reducing this to \"a difference of opinion\" or that you \"don't care about politics\" other such things: you do not fully grasp the gravity of the situation, most likely because the consequences would not effect you. The policies that these people, especially Mitch McConnell, represent put actual people in real danger. If you can understand that the people who took this too far aren't just \"a difference of opinion,\" then you certainly have the mental capacity to understand that what happened here isn't either. You're just choosing not to. Imagine if he had supported people that might have great platforms on the economy, foreign policy, the works. Except they also openly and loudly hold policies that would directly harm you, your friends, your family, etc. You would rightfully be upset. Then imagine that everyone who chooses to support Scott either way dismissed your criticism as \"just a difference of opinion\". This is what you are doing. This is especially jarring coming from fellow LGBTQ fans. You are not special. They will come for you just as they come for everyone else. To tie this back into FNAF with a quote, you will not be spared. You will not be saved. At best, you will be used as an excuse for them to go \"look, we don't hate all of you!\" while they continue to do things that harm the rest of us and eventually you when you outgrow your usefulness. Please do not fall for it. I don't care whether you choose to continue to support Scott or not. What I do care about is that you understand why people are upset and not just scream \"cancel culture!!!\" when people attempt to hold someone accountable for the harmful things they do. Whatever Scott's intentions were, you have to understand that this support is going towards the anti-LGBTQ stances these people hold. They go towards the people that downplayed the Covid-19 pandemic and lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands. Even if he didn't intend for it, that's what happened and you need to understand that and you need to understand that that's why people are upset, especially when at least some of this money was from them purchasing his games. They were unintentionally and unknowingly funding the very people who want to erase them from existence and they have the right to be upset. Again, like I said, death threats and doxing are a step way too far. But to completely discredit the criticisms of everyone just because of them is unwise, especially when nearly everyone on both sides would agree that they were unacceptable.",

While I disagree with supporting Trump, I know you never intended to hurt anybody, and I applaud you for being honest about yourself here. Giving this much money to these specific people was certainly a mistake, but all that really matters is your intention here. People have every right to be upset you helped fund these people, but they 100% took this too far. WAY too far. Doxing you isn\u2019t just disrespectful, it\u2019s a full on crime, and I can\u2019t imagine how hard all this stuff must have been for you and your family. Even if you really were super racist or whatever, none of you deserve to go through something like this, especially not while pregnant. You did the right thing here. Might be too late for some people, but I\u2019m gonna try to remain hopeful. Again, I don\u2019t entirely agree with your reasonings here, but who am I to start a random political debate with you? If you were being directly enabling violence or something, that\u2019d be one thing, but this whole mess started because some random jerk wanted to ruin your reputation as an inside joke. Don\u2019t let anything people say about you hold you down, everybody makes mistakes, and even if you still stand by what you did, all that matters is your intention.",

My primary concern is that my money is potentially going to the likes of Mitch McConnell, Ben Carson, etc who have enacted legislation that has actively worsened my life and the lives of those I love.  I will be buying used copies of your games from here onward, as my conscious does not sit happily knowing where my money ends up.  I hope you understand where I am coming from as a queer person. EDIT: I will say that I FIRMLY DISAPPROVE of doxxing and death threats being sent to your family. I am extremely empathetic - my mother has had many miscarriages and I understand secondhand the fear a parent has when it comes to possibly losing family in that regard. I'm sorry it happened, and I hope it stops immediately.",

        "Comment": "I made a comment here right after this response was released that expressed my gratitude for you here. But, being honest, it was so in the moment and out of pure shock and emotion, that I don't know if it's as genuine as I thought. I've done some thinking, and to be honest, I don't even know what to think anymore. While it is true that it seems you are against bigotry, be it homophobia, racism, transphobia, whatever, and I believe you in saying that... I don't see how supporting Mitch McConnell really reflects that at all. I mean, you say that you think the other side wants to do things even worse for the LGBT community, but you never specified what that means. And frankly, I'm starting to think you aren't being honest on that much, and that your reasons for voting and supporting the politicians that you do are more self-serving, for you and your family. Yet, at the same time, I know you aren't like that. Or at least, I don't think you are. You've donated millions to charities, you've always been kind to the community. And I do believe you aren't a bigot. But I will never understand what can be more important than the rights of others when voting for someone. But at the end of the day, whatever conclusion I come to, this community won't be the same without Scott Cawthon. So it seems my options are: stick with this franchise, but the original creator isn't even here anymore, or decide to leave, as because of one reason or another, nothing will be the same again. Again, apologies to your family for having to go through all of the fear and threats taking place right now. I don't think in any situation that's okay. And while I can empathize with you on that much, that doesn't mean I'm 100% for you here, because as I said, I just don't get it. Yes, I'm sure you don't agree with 100% of what these politicians believe, especially when it comes to Civil Rights matters. But the fact of the matter is, you still gave money to them and their anti-LGBT legislation, even if that's not where you wanted your money to go. And I don't know what could have been so important that you decided to give so much money to them, despite their homophobic or transphobic ideas. I just can't understand that. tl;dr. Can't decide what the hell to think about this anymore. But no matter what, this series won't be the same again, so I might just pack my bags and leave.",

Some people will still be upset or dislike you, and some will feel you can be forgiven. The fact of the matter is, I am very pleased to know that you didn't do this out of malice or out of distaste for any minorities, especially the LGBTQ+ community. I'm very glad to see that despite what some may believe based off your beliefs that you're a very accepting person, and it makes me happy to see how much you care about your fans. I'm deeply sorry that this drama caused you and your family any fear (especially with the doxxing part), but I'm happy to know that at the very least, you do care, and you never meant to harm anyone. While I do hope in the future you'll put a little more thought into how others will be affected by these sorts of donations, I am glad that you've apologized. Your apology is very clearly genuine, and from the heart; and with a situation like this, it takes guts to say anything at all. So thank you for saying this Scott. I hope everyone can learn from this situation and how we as a fanbase can better handle controversies, and how you as a creator can better connect with the minorities in the fanbase. At the end of the day, we're all human, and it's nice to see that you are so willing to put everything on the line just to say sorry about something that wasn't even our business in the first place. Anyways, I'm bad at ending text-based messages so I'll just leave it at a small message to my fellow fans: I hope we can all move forward, and even if you don't forgive him, at least acknowledge that he does care.",

And his vice president supports abuse and forced conversion therapy for lgbt youth. It's just a lot of mixed signals and I just don't understand people who value the economy over actual life, what's the pro-life in that?",

However, I feel like you cannot say you support your LGBT fans or minorities in your fan base if you still actively donate to people who want to get rid of our rights. Mitch McConnell was the most shocking donation to me, and the fact Scott donated the max he could was most surprising. Just a simple Google search tells you how McConnell feels about us. I will always defend your right to be a Republican and any other opinions you may hold, but ONLY if they don't harm others. You can't use voting for a Democrat as proof that you support other opinions if you still support lawmakers who actively harm this community. You have created an amazing franchise that brought me so so much joy while I was struggling in college. I don't want you to just leave this community, but I also want you to take your fans' disappointment to heart and not ignore it by just leaving the platform entirely. These are people that buy your games and love them, people that have made a whole community and fan base about how much they adore this franchise. We just want you to see how supporting lawmakers like this can actively hurt us and our rights as people. I'm sorry this had to happen, but not addressing other concerns is a huge issue.",

        "Comment": "First off, I legitimately am sorry that you and your family are facing death threats. Regardless of how much I disagree with your stance, and how the rest of my post will sound, nobody should face that. Genuinely, I wish you and your family the best, and I hope the doxxing and threats end. With that said, I'm really disappointed by your post. I understand how some people were mislead by Trump. What I don't understand is how you can still support someone like him after you saw how terrible of a person he was during his tenure. You've never said or denounced anything about how much damage Trump did to our democracy, our LGBTQ friends, to people's lives in regards to how he handled the pandemic, and hundreds of other reasons. You still supported that man and his cronies that held him up. You've also donated to some of the most vile and evil politicians this country has ever seen. Mitch McConnell is somehow worse than Trump and doesn't even try to hide it, yet you actually made a financial donation to it. You allude to supporting Kimberly Klacik and Tulsi Gabbard, but don't mentioned that you financially donated and support evil people like McConnell, Nunes, Stefanik, etc. If you support their platforms, that's fine, but own up to it.  You have to go out of your way to donate to these people. I'm a republican. I'm a Christian. I'm pro-life. I believe in God. I also believe in equality, and in science, and in common sense. Despite what some may say, all of those things can go together. That's not an apology or promise to change, it's the way it's always been. None of those things apply to Trump besides him being pro-life. The guy has five children with three different wives. One of which he cheated on with a porn star while she was pregnant. He openly denied and mocked science, and as a result the US did horrible when it came to covid-19. You are either completely brainwashed and blinded by whatever media you consume, or you genuinely support all of these beliefs that the republican platform stands for. If it's the former, please educate yourself more and seek better news coverage.",

In where I live, we, teenagers have a lot of stress because of the government but FNaF always relieved my stress. It's your choice to leave, thank you for changing so many lives and what you did for good. We love you Scott. <3",

        "Comment": "Scott, you actually pulled me out of the mindset that the people who are canceling you have a very long time ago. If you decide to never interact with the community again, the majority of us people who have common sense and don't call for blood due to diffrent beliefs will miss you greatly, in fact those who hate you for your beliefs will slowly notice it's not the same either. I have been in this fandom since the beginning, and i have never told anyone this, but I'm trans and nearly picked Cawthon as my middle name because i want to be like you in the sense that you always try to do the right thing (I finally settled on Henry as a first name seeing as he's a character you created). The people who nosed into your personal info had no right too, it's disgusting. I myself have had this same sort of thing happen to be for the past six years and i know how scary the feeling of being hunted feels. I am not shocked by your beliefs, but just know I like people who try to do the right thing and follow their own heart, not people who have my same beliefs down to a T or follow the crowd. I have also decided to dedicate my first novel to you along with other amazing people, you are the person who got me into writing and back into the art world. I also strongly know for a fact, and this is something that other people should know, is that you would never do anything to purposefully harm others. You aren't out to get anyone. I truly wish you the best in life and hope everything turns out okay, these are upsetting and sensitive times. ~Henry",

Those at the top it\u2019s almost like a sickness it\u2019s all about the shareholders and making profit. Never about the people. I worked for a company long ago that had a yearly meeting ever worker went to . In the meeting the ceo said last year we made our biggest profit ever 30 million dollars . (Small/medium fabrication factory. ) Next year we want it to be 40 million. That is the problem with the current system in place it will never be good enough . It could be a 30 million profit or a 30 billion profit they will still look to make more and screw people over in the process. Their workers work full time for them and still have to get government help . But they made double the profit as last year!!! To double up on the problems the corporations basically run everything now so it\u2019s very hard to fight against it. Fuck the workers , fuck the people , fuck the planet it doesn\u2019t matter as long as they make profit.",

I'm going through the same thing and thankfully getting by with, \"Waiting on an official fix from Microsoft\". Not sure how long this will last without hearing from them but some random articles suggest Cyber attack and others like this thread suggest bad updates. I see everyone bypassing anti-malware and I'm still hesitant to even give that a whirl in an abundance of caution. Anyone else else on the same boat and can counter with a more concrete response besides what OP is saying. I do believe it's on the right track but why is disabling the anti-malware the first thing that comes to mind as a good workaround? Thanks!",

Hotfix to be released asap to strip out the offending 2022-serial number sig files. Temp workaround is to add a 13th month to 2021 for the signatures - i.e. the next sig after 211231nnnn will be 211301nnnn. So welcome to the 13th month of 2021! Edit: Looks like they preferred to go with the 33rd day of December - i.e. 2112330001. Interesting ... only 2 months to fix it if you do this, i.e. before 211299nnnn.

They believe in survey results, in graphs, numbers that represent people's decisions and ideas. They feed their mind with information validated outside of their heads. For them, if results of different surveys or information seem accurate to lots of people, these results are accurate too. They don't stop and internally process if the information seems reasonable inside their heads. They dont validate it internally. They just accept it. Ti: Ti users, in contrast to Te users, rely heavily on what makes sense to themselves, Internally. They dont tend to trust outside sources that much. That's the reason of the \"arguing\" stereotype of xntp's. Ti's tend to make up their own theories and opinions, while Te's opinions are more of a \"collection\" and average of other trusted people's opinions. Of course I'm not saying Te's can't think \"originally\" and not copy, just that their main source of information is other people and outside sources. Makes sense to me from what I've observed and experienced.",

I knew it!\" & might well cite it to others in the future, mostly because it saves having to explain it from the top, & I notice that it does convince other people while their eyes usually glaze over soon if I explain from the bottom up.",

Knowing how cute their first meeting was (Venti coming to visit, Zhongli preparing to come to his aid, turned out Venti just wanted to hang out and thus leading to the tradition of the Archons' drinking party in Liyue) I really want to see them reunited again. I feel like Zhongli can really let loose with Venti given how he sounded describing Venti as opposed to his generally well-composed tone. Pretty sure he misses him according to the osmanthus wine line too, together with the other original Sevens. I hope the \" wind \" will return to Liyue again someday. Losing his peers one by one until he remained all alone, ultimately leading to that decision he made to step down after persevering for so long... it'd do both of them good to see each other again, reliving the olden days. Sorry for the word vomit, I've been thinking about them the past few days and just... all the feels. Thank you so much for the gorgeous artwork. I love your original design for Zhongli's attire, and they both look beautiful in your style! <3",

I think it makes sense they didn't want the website to actually exist or have products while making a commentary on the people who went to the website about the same \"consumerist capitalist bullshit during a pandemic\" Rick was talking about. They just bought the domain because Rick & Morty is huge and if they didn't, someone else would buy the domain to sell their own fucking bullshit while coasting on the fandom.  Which is funny because denying other people the opportunity to do business or taking advantage of your IP is also hyper-capitalistic by itself lol.",

        "Comment": "Scary how a lot of them are already clearly developing. The only reason why this is not immediately apparent in the same way as the cold war was is becouse China just buys nations instead of using  military pressure. So its less of a cold military war but more a cold economic war. But a large conflict none the less. The internet. It was supposed to revolution the way the world communicates and would bring everyone together. In reality its used as a weapon to sow internal conflict and undermine progress. Right now it made people a lot of money, but it may very well be the cause of the next depression if not brought under control. Wrong, but only becouse they picked the wrong things for Russia to devolve into. If they were just going to say its not a liberal democracy. It would be correct. Nailed it down perfectly. Eastern and western Europe are two completely different areas with extremely different ideas. This fracture may prove to much to heal. In the best case scenario we see the return of the Iron curtain with a liberal democracy on the west and a far right authoritarian regime on the right. But a collapse of Europe with various new conflicts can in the long run not be ruled out. Not yet. But if nothing is done, its just a matter of when this one starts. Sort of. While the average person is not scared of being blown up. Terrorism is going mainstream as a method in political debates. With threatening aggressive actions seen more and more as a justifiable means of protest and defended by politicians when they see fit. Its not do what I say or we will blow up another school. But more do what I say or we will disrupt national transportation or riot. Smaller scale acts of terrorism like burning down buildings are also becoming more common as a result of this. While the hospitals are not overrun with cancer. Pollution is starting to make large impacts on city planning with housing projects or roads being disrupted by concerns of negative health effects. Its not a case where being to late is causing the disruptions. But our efforts to prevent this just not being free of economic consequences. Check. Europe went through a mayor gas crisis a few months ago with prices doubling in just a few weeks time and fuel jumping 50 cents per liter. Things have stabilized now, but the effects still haven't fully hit the consumer yet. The political rammifications of being this dependent on Russian gas for a while also arent clear yet. The number was just a guess so may prove to be wrong. But its undeniable a near perfect prediction of Corona. You just have to look at backlash towards measures to combat climate change, obesity, Corona or other mayor issues to see this one in action.",

        "Comment": "My impression is that the list goes always a bit too far in its scenarios, but still things going in all those directions did happen. While relations with China are indeed not good, overall they seem far from a cold war, let alone a hot one, with the markets still relying strongly on China and all. The advent of smartphones and social media, and the detrimental role these technologies have played in mental health and politics could apply. But it's not like there was a big technological failure or anything, outside of maybe too much wide-eyed optimism regarding what the Internet would be socially. Russia did not become a democratic country, and it is working on annexing some territories, but it's not to the extent that it threatens Europe. The European Union's original momentum has slowed down, but it did achieve a union of most stable European countries. Climate change has continued to become a bigger problem, though not in the way the article thinks. There was no major rise of terrorism, but the effect was achieved nonetheless in the US and Europe with great success, thanks to just a few key, incredibly traumatic events. Pollution remains a big problem, but only the poor actually suffer from it. The health system however, was indeed ill-prepared to face other problems. There was no new energy crisis. The Middle East has problems though, but they didn't result in an energy crisis. Turns out, it wasn't even necessary to get a terrible plague for the world's healthcare systems to crack... There is undeniably a reactionary movement in the West. Is it going to send us back to the dark ages though? That seems unlikely, as it could also be the last gasps of a dying system. But time will tell.",

        "Comment": "So.... professional forecaster here. I get paid to make forecasts on future events for a company called Good Judgment. Feel free to research it and join the Open Competition if you can. In order to get invited to join the professional team you have to finish in the top ten in the world (out of tens of thousands of forecasters) over a year or so. One of the main items in any forecast is the question has to have a specific criteria for resolution, in a specific time frame, and specific wording that is not ambiguous. Every single one of these potential items fails all of the criteria. So none of these would even be acceptable questions for us to forecast. Why? Because every one could be subjectively answered as True or False at virtually any time with no cut off. Look at the China/US cold war one. A true question we might get at GJ would be \"will there be a military fatality of a US soldier caused by the Chinese army by 1/1/22.\" Specific criteria, over a specific time with no ambiguity for resolution. The \"technology is a bust\" is atrocious, and not even anything close to specific or unambiguous. Some are routine parts of the cycle of the world (famines for example). When you have people that live in non-arable swaths of land famines happen. Especially when dictators control the food supply. I could go through every one, and will if anyone cares. But reading the comments it is clear to me that everyone reads the ambiguity in the questions and resolves them however they see fit. It's exactly what charlatans and psychics do.",

        "Comment": "Note that NTR is primarily a hentai/porn category. What often gets missed with NTR, and why it's different from cheating. Is that the target for the NTR and the person you're meant to identify with is the main character, so it's far closer to \"cuckolding\" than cheating. The whole purpose of it is that the sex/cheating is done in a way specifically to insult/degrade the main relationship, it's meant to instill the reader with anguish, anger, pain and such. So for example a cheating story would be something like the a lonely housewife falling for a young man that's moved into her appartment and them begining an affair. Can be NTR, but it's fairly mild. An NTR story would be an office worker bringing his boss back home with him for dinner, them getting drunk together, him passing out and the boss then co-ercing his wife into having sex with him in their bed, which she then loves and gets hooked on. It would then transition to things like the wife sucking the boss off at work under his desk, or having sex with him in the next room, all those kind'a things. The core aspect is that the guy is oblivious to it, but the wife and the boss are having sex in a way that's practically taunting him with their affair. You'd expect things like it to be repeatedly pointed out that the boss is a better lover, that he's got a bigger dick, that the wife doesn't care about her husband anymore. Probably will end with the wife pregnant and the husband raising another man's child. You've got similar stories for anything else, childhood friend being fucked while the guy she loves can't quite work up the courage to confess, etc etc. Think of it as romance destruction. It's meant to make the reader upset. It's not meant to be a pleasant thing. But with it being such a mainstream idea now, the term's been thrown around a lot and loses a lott'a meaning, then you have people saying things like \"It's fine, I self insert as the bad guy!\" which goes against the whole point of it.",

Its genre where MC/FMC will get mentally and/or physically destroyed but some dick/slut who doesnt give shit about them and will cheat them with all kind of people (could be  only one) and disrespect FMC/MC.  In end FMC/MC would walk in room and see their wife/gf/bf/gf/husband fuck with other person. ntr manga: <H-mate> <Drug candy> </Blush-DC.> (this one have good story for NTR) <Household affairs> (this one is not HC because it starts right away IMO) If you want real NTR stuff then I suggest to go to hentai sites (can recommend those too xD) and see what ntr means xD",

        "Comment": "I personally don't hate ntr, I personally don't hate any plot device. I think all could be used amazingly well but also horribly wrong. First the proper meaning of NTR is when the protagonist partner whom they are DATING is taken away from them, so yeah cheating. But over time people started overgeneralising the word to love triangles or even when girl has never noticed MC before but starts dating someone else. Why? because ntr has a more negative connotation to it. (Not advocating for anything but it's the best example i can think of)  Paedophilia, it means attraction to prepubescent kids, but the word has been generalised to include anyone under 17 to get a more negative response. It's just a thing humans do, there so many words that have been overgeneralised with it's negative connotation. Although i won't say that it's the only reason. Well some people like to self insert themselves into the protagonist shoes, so if the protagonist has a harem, they have a harem.(probably why harem anime/manga has a stable market) So when the girl is taken away from the MC she's taken away from them, and of course they won't like that. So same thing now starts to happen in situations that have been generalised under ntr, they are already unconsciously having a negative reaction to it. Now the problem with real NTR is that it has been used lazily most of the time. I really haven't seen a manga where i saw ntr and didn't feel like it wasn't forced.",

Ntr (as a whole) is a form of plot focused onto describe the manner in which a character is deprived of something he/she treasures; being this something as concrete as a partner or merely abstract as a friendship or its sense of trust. In regular manga NTR is not synonim of cheating, instead, is used as drama fuel aimed to problematize the emotional (usually romatic) relationship between two or more actors, and usually do not have further consecuences. Menwhile in Hentai manga NTR is used as representation of cheating, betrayal or infidelity, and it's always a consequence.",

The difference is in whom you you are meant to empathize with: the person being cuckolded in the case of netorare, and the person 'stealing' the partner in the case of netori. Netorare tends to have a lot of superficial hate towards it because it's meant to make you feel shitty with heavy emotional effect and so on, so it's not something a lot of people want to read. There's also the issue that it's poorly used to make some lots of truly terrible hentai.",

        "Comment": "There's a page on Factions in the Codex Arcana, but the actual spells and items you can craft don't show up until you're at the Tier where you can access them, and by then you've already picked a faction, so I'll list them here. Fey: Mushroom Soldiers and Pixies will now aid you in combat, although the allies of other factions will now attack you. Can craft the Bracelet of Trickery at Tier 3, which turns you invisible and makes your unarmed punch deal knockback as long as you are sneaking.  You also unlock the following spells: Briarthorne Barrier (immune to things like cactus), Confuse (makes mobs hostile to nearest mob/player), and Decoy (create an illusion copy of yourself to draw mob aggro). Can craft the Spectral Elytra at Tier 5, which is basically a mana-fueled elytra with hypothetical infinite flight.  You also unlock the spells Heal (gain HP) and Greater Invisibility (invisibility that affects armor and held items). Wizard: Spellbreakers and Witch Hunters will now aid you in combat, although the allies of other factions will now attack you. Can craft the Ley Line Bracelet at Tier 3, which recharges your mana faster near ley lines (visible with a special ointment they also unlock at this tier).  You also unlock the Arcane Damage spell (deals damage and drains mana from victim). At Tier 4 you unlock the Animus spell (animates blocks to attack enemies for you). Can craft the Arcane Crown at Tier 5, which gives you bonus mana and occasionally clears debuffs.  You also unlock the spells Mana Shield (protects you from incoming damage) and Mana Transfer (gives some of your mana to the target). Demon: Imps and Lantern Wraiths will now aid you in combat, although the allies of other factions will now attack you. Can craft the Emberglow Bracelet at Tier 3, which gives fire immunity while worn. At Tier 4 you unlock the spells Cauterize (take a little damage and gain regen), Explosion (obvious), and Nethergate (teleport between overworld and nether). Can craft the Hellfire Staff at Tier 5, which buffs the damage, radius, range, and burn duration of fire-themed spells.  It also makes your flames green when igniting or damaging things.  Spells unlocked are Absorption (like a golden apple), Fire Shield (burns mobs in melee range), and Life Tap (affected creatures grant you health when you hurt them). Also, make sure you have the correct mote in your hand when you summon the faction (air for Fey, arcane for Wizard, fire for Demon).  For the Demon, you also need to make sure to bring some form of fire protection or healing, as you will be on fire for the duration of the ritual.",

If you really wanna stick it to YouTube then use those to watch creators that have moved over. I think there\u2019s even an extension to tel you if a creator uploaded on Odysee too. The more people do that the more creators see it as a viable option and the more likely it is for YouTube to have to adapt or die. They\u2019ve obviously grown too big and can/will make changes or govern itself on its own accord. Plus you get tokens just for using Library or Odysee with an address/account attached. (Tokens you can sell OR use to contribute to creators directly)",

Edit, stupid formatting, the exact search string has backticks around it, and I want those in the search as well. I know the search works without them",

In 10 years the same people cheering this will be crying and calling it an invasion of their privacy when they find you that they're on \"the list\". Imagine if this same exact thing, had been proposed in 2017, under Donald Trump. How would you feel about it then? How would you feel about Donald Trump starting up this exact same program against say Antifa? And you can bet Antifa WILL be on this list. If you don't like this in 2017 with Donald Trump at the helm, you should not like it now.",

Eugen Schwab was director of the factory of the Swiss company Escher Wyss in Ravensburg when Klaus Schwab was born in 1938. The family was privileged. They say director, but I see elsewhere he was described as commercial director. And the company was probably a subsidiary of Escher Wyss called Andritz: https://www.andritz.com/hydro-en/about-andritz-hydro/locations/ravensburg-germany Eugen was also \"President of the Upper Swabian Chamber of Industry and Commerce\"... https://www.zvab.com/1867-1967-100-Jahre-Oberschw%C3%A4bische-Industrie-/465143460/bd ...if the date of publication of that book fits, which it would appear to, and there weren't any other prominent Eugen Schwab's in the area at that time.",

(I'm a bot) T. he curious relationship between one of the world's biggest drug makers and President Trump's personal lawyer began early last year when Michael Cohen, a longtime fixer for the president, reached out to Novartis's then-chief executive officer Joe Jimenez, promising help gaining access to Trump and influential officials in the new administration, according to an employee inside Novartis familiar with the matter. The extent to which Novartis conducted any due diligence into Cohen or his track record as a Trump insider and Washington player is uncertain. The meeting was a disappointment, the insider explained, and the Novartis squad left with the impression that Cohen and Essential Consultants - the firm controlled by Cohen that Novartis was making payments to - may not be able to deliver.

Different from psilocybin and MDMA therapies thare are currently researched ketamines effect seem to be transient and need to be administered every 10 days or so. I am not sure if this also is true for ketamine enhanced psychotherapy which is what FTRP seems to focus on. If they are also going for other substances feel free to correct me, but CMPS, CYBN, MYCO, NUMI, RVV, SHRM, TRIP, MMED, ATAI and most other players go for psilocybin or LSD. NUMI also goes for ketamine, but not just ketamine.",

It can be very therapeutic. It's has the potential to help a lot of people without drugs that you depend on every day. I just went to buy a small position with dividend money but my broker charges commission on otc stuff. It was too small of a buy to justify paying a huge percent as a fee. I'll stick to the commission free stocks. Don't bet the farm on it because it could take a decade to even be profitable. But maybe you can sell half if the stock if musk mentions it.",

It peaked around 5.15 per share earlier this week and I waited, expecting it to drop a bit after the WSB hype died off. It's down around 3.98 (despite the news that they recently acquired an AI company to help expediate clinical trials: https://seekingalpha.com/news/3663492-mindmed-acquiring-machine-learning-company-healthmode ). FTRPF has dipped just below $6, but the research here has me interested. Trying to gather as much info as I can and keep my expectations level. Any insight would be appreciated. Thanks.",

No matter how complex the lore may get at times, or how long we have to go between content, I always get excited to see new stuff relating to FNaF. Even ignoring the games themselves, you as a person have continuously inspired me. You've always been very passionate about the fanbase as well as the games themselves, you've been respectful to everyone, you put so much care and effort into every project, and you've overall always just been a very good, kind person. You don't deserve any of this unnecessary drama at all. What you do is ultimately up to you, but don't let Twitter scare you. Me as well as hundreds of thousands of other people will always love and appreciate you. I don't know how to put into words how much good you've done for millions of people. I wish the best for you and your family, take care.",

Good luck, i hope this situation will have the Happy End. And sorry for my bad english.",

Jesus christ... I'm not surprised that all this fucking shitshow came from fucking twitter. HE NEVER WANTED to hurt certain groups of people, N E V E R, but because some people react like assholes before waiting for an official response by scott... we ended up like this, and he is actually thinking about retiring... We don't deserve someone like Scott, if he doesn't want to interact anymore with us... I will totally get it.",

If people think I'm doing more harm than good now, then maybe it's better that I get cancelled and retire. I would accept that. I've had a fulfilling career. Besides, most things that people can take from you are things that never had much value to begin with.\" This is what the haters have been missing this entire time. You don't do it for the money, and that's what makes you, well, you! No other person making a game is as supportive as you are. Yes you some times make mistakes but that's what makes you human. I'm tired of living in a world that once you make a mistake it ruins your life forever. Scott, if you're reading this (which I doubt) Stay with us. You really are an amazing person, even if people don't agree with you on the political compass. We now know you supported these people because you thought they were doing their best. You don't see the bad in people. Which makes you lovable. You never really got into politics. You, a father, should not be afraid of people trying to break into your house. I have been a fan since day 1, and I never thought this would happen in a million years. But, that's just how things are now. We didn't know the reason why you donated to these people and people were already sending threats. I wish you the best",

However, a lifetime of pain levied upon me by my Christian upbringing has led me to feel quite hurt by this. I have nothing against God or Christ. What I do have a problem with is the way that American Christian culture blends Christianity with un-Christian political views and unrelated American culture. Growing up, I felt different. I tried to give my life to God, but I was never doing it \u201ccorrectly\u201d according to my church and school. Loving God was never enough. I had to love God while being unadulteratedly patriotic, manly, and conservative. This was never said out loud, but it was communicated in other ways. When I saw the way that Trump treated the least of these, it disgusted me. When I tried to speak up about it, the culture won. My Christian friends and family slowly pushed me out, and I realized that it was never just about God. When I see people donate to Trump or the GOP, all I can remember is the pain. And seeing one of my favorite game creators of all time donate to him still made me hurt, even if that donation isn\u2019t directly tied to an ideological stance. What happened to you is awful and I\u2019m truly sorry. But as long as that culture continues to gatekeep and judge the people who have been sorely deprived of love, I\u2019m not sure I can take supporting it to mean anything else. Best of luck, Scott. Sorry people were so awful to you.",

For all of this to be piled onto you while your wife is pregnant, congratulations by the way you must be stressed as all heck. I suggest taking a little holiday as it's the summer, places are beginning to open up and you could bring a laptop or something to keep an eye on Security Breach. It might help take the stress off your wife too. In my opinion, Cancellers are like the digital incarnation of Karens. They see one thing that somebody says or does that they don't agree with and immediately jump onto it. Pair that with the fact that nowadays it's so much easier to connect with other people online and the fact that internet access is just so common now, and you have a force to be aware of. They jump onto issues every time they're discovered and most of the time, the victims don't respond as far as I know. So making a stand is a good move. Retiring is your choice and only yours. Don't let other people push/force you to make that decision. If you do decide to retire, then it's been a fun, wild, and sometimes inspiring run. Thank you.",

Ever. But some do have a point in saying they're upset that Scott made these donations to political figures that actively work against their right to exist. Scott said he himself isn't supportive of anti-LGBT or racism, sexism etc, but there's also the fact he still supported sexist, homophobic and racist people. The Racism, Sexism and Homophobia weren't deal breakers. Depending on when he donated, he could look past the fact that the person he supported incited a riot based on a lie about the presidential vote. Thats the issue so many people have, the major issues weren't major enough to Scott to make him vote someone else. This is hurtful, especially since I myself am Gay. I still love the series and am excited for SB, and will probably continue to support the series. Been here since Markiplier's first play through so I have a close connection with the series . One thing I think people often forget is that nobody is black and white. Nobody is purely awful or purely good, at least rarely.  While Scott donated to some awful people, he also donated so much to St Jude's. End of the day he's just another man, trying to find the best way to live in the world. Of course he will make mistakes EDIT : Spelling and grammar",

He wants the best out of everyone he doesn't care whether your straight, gay trans whatever you are Scott cares for you and everyone. I 100% think Scott didn't know that they were against LGBTQ community at the time he was only donating for the good part of them not the part of removing LGBTQ rights. Also this donation was so long ago that Scott probably forgotten about donating to them. I am apart of the community. I am bisexual, but I know that Scott donated to them with good intentions. Scott always has good intentions and isn't a bad person he is an angel. The amount of money he has given away is spectacular. the amount of children he has visited for their final wishes. Why are we looking at somthing that was done so long ago we are looking at somthing so minuscule. but we aren't looking at what he has done good like donate hundreds of thousands of dollars to charity.",

You and your family do not deserve to be stalked, doxxed, harassed, or threatened for your political beliefs. That being said, I don't disagree with the many people who are concerned by some of the politicians you've donated to. There are some genuinely terrible people on that list, with many concerning views and policies, and I don't blame the people who are upset to see that. Those under the LGBT flag, especially. I think it's fair to be concerned and feel betrayed. I dont think youre a bad person, Scott. I know you've done a lot of good for charities, employed multiple highly diverse people, advocated for minorities, etc. I also dont think you should be lambasted or lose everything for your beliefs. You've shown time and time again that you care for so many people, and I will never deny that. With all that, I have to say that I'm highly conflicted with everything. I really don't know how to feel. This situation is messy, complicated, and incredibly unfortunate. I hope you and your family remain safe, and I wish the best to you and your wife. I know that a pregnancy can be a tumultuous time to begin with, but having this added stress can't be helpful. I don't know whether or not I'll continue purchasing the games in the series, as I sincerely don't want to inadvertently fund people who I feel want to harm myself and people close to me. I hope everyone can remain civil and understand that this isn't as black and white as some would like to make it out to be. Scott, I hope you can understand the depths of people's concern. I hope you can see through the unreasonable hatred and absolutely disgusting conduct of some, and read the valid concerns people have with who you've sent substantial amounts of money to. There's a good reason for people to be upset, and you voting red isn't all this boils down to and I hope you can see that despite the irrationality you've been met with.",

Not sure if this will be considered a controversial response but I can\u2019t lie about how I feel about this I was never bothered by your views. Knowing you were a Christian from Texas and how you responded to people\u2019s reaction to the Desolate Hope\u2019s ending a while back, I could put two and two together and determine what your views were, and I was and still am ok with that. Even if I don\u2019t personally agree, I don\u2019t care because I still know you\u2019re a great guy who\u2019s done so much for the community and so many other people My only problem was with the donations themselves. I mean no offense, but you donated to a billionaire that hasn\u2019t shown all that much care for about 4 and a half percent of the US population, a lot of which are likely in this fandom. Again I don\u2019t care who you vote for or what you align with, and I don\u2019t know why I feel this way, but I guess by supporting you, in a twisted way, it almost feels like I\u2019m supporting them? I know that\u2019s not how it works but I can\u2019t get that thought out of my head and it bothers me What I\u2019m trying to say is I want to support you, not some rich guy, and I wish you the best, because you don\u2019t deserve the situation you\u2019re in right now at all Edit - Also congrats on the new Fnaf playtester kid!",

I will probably continue to enjoy fnaf as I have for many years, but I will be rethinking how and when I choose to spend money on this franchise or buying games directly. While I agree we can all have different opinions; I think most people's problem with it was that they knew money they were supplying to this brand would potentially now knowingly be going to a party that has worked consistently to discriminate against and keep down marginalized people. It is pride month. Right now republicans of all different backgrounds and states are trying to implement policies that would greatly harm trans kids, and I think that regardless of how nice or well thought out a person's explanation is, I can't personally consent to see my money potentially go to those causes. I wish Scott a safe and comfortable life, but as a trans person and as someone who speaks with my dollar, I think my future money would be better spent amongst the fans who create, or going directly to donations. Scott can choose to put his money where he likes, as can I. I'm not sure what this will mean for Security Breach as it was the first FNAF game I was anticipating buying and playing on my own. I think at this point I am going to be more comfortable just watching a ytber play it, but maybe this will change. Just my two cents.",

You saved many lives without really knowing it, whether it be financially, emotionally, school-related, and so on. You inspired so many of us with your work. Thanks to you, I found an amazing hobby, I found amazing friends, even more, and loving followers of my work and channel. You revolutionized a part of the horror genre. May people say what they want, objectively FNaF did reinvent a part of the horror genre. Politics didn't have to be involved in there. THIS shouldn't have been shown AT ALL. Whether you be republican, democrat, you had the intelligence to never show your political opinion in here, and thank you for that, I wish more people would do that because either many of us don't care about politics, are traumatized by politics (do i need to give an example) or are too young to even understand (don't worry, even for us young adults it's hard to understand...). The ones who leaked your donations aren't even part of the fandom, they just did this to fuck around. Well, sorry for what I'm about to say, but fuck them. Hard. If it's your last post, may you take a great rest from this. I do hope that everything will get better for you, your wife, your children and soon-to-be newborn.",

Me personally do not care if you're Republican or a Trump supporter. The reason why people are mad is because you're donating thousands of dollars to politicians who are trying to limit/remove rights from the LGBTQ+ community. I understand that you support those politicians mostly for their other views, but you're still contributing to the problem. If you do care about the lives of ALL human beings, then why not donate money to the LGBTQ+ community? I think that is fair considering you donated money to anti-LGBT politicians.

Seeing all these people claim you\u2019d believe all these things just because of who you\u2019ve given money to was heart breaking. I couldn\u2019t believe such nasty things were being said about you before you\u2019d had a chance to react. I can only imagine how scary it must have been for you and your family to get death threats from random strangers who may have obtained your home address. I hope that you can all mentally recover from this event. I\u2019m sorry that so many people jumped to conclusions. I tried my best to use my voice on Twitter through FNAF Alerts to tell people not to assume such rash things, but the platform is a beast nobody can tame. I knew that none of what they were saying was true, and I knew it was your right as an American to support whatever politicians you believed were best for this country. As someone I look up to, I actually did a school project about your life and what lead to your success, and I knew from that research that you were not someone who would be so discriminatory. I of course had doubts, everyone did, but I held on to my faith in you, and I\u2019m so relieved to know I was right to do so. Thank you for this response, I\u2019m sure it was difficult to write. I will keep supporting your work as much as possible by continuing to expand my never ending collection of merchandise. Thank you for being, like, the most awesome person in the world.

I'm also bisexual, and a transgender man, the experiences and things I learned being queer are a big part of who I am, I would be a really different person if I were cishet. I don't want to make this about you being christian, republican and/or pro-life, I really don't want to, but I guess its going to be interpreted as that. I do not approve in any way the doxxing, its objectively shitty and in bad taste. I also do not support the fact that somebody just went up to dig the donations, but at the same time it feels so shitty to see you donating so much to charity, being the \"dad\" of this fandom, only to find out that behind doors you were also donating to politicians that want to take the rights of my community away. I understand that you did it for the economy, I understand that you never wished any ill intention on us, I understand that you were only using your liberty, but I also need you to understand that the anti-lgbt decisions of those politicians affect us in every aspect of our lives, and that by donating money to them it only helps them to continue those anti-lgbt decisions. If the politicians were democrats instead of republicans, this would still be my reaction. I do not think you're a transphobe, a homophobe or something like that, but please, understand why a lot of us feels afraid, hurt, betrayed and angry. Its not about side teams, its about our lifes. To see somebody we looked up and cared, directly funding those who treat us like a plague. Edit: Sorry about the edits, I'm not really good expressing myself with words",

I owe you the fact that I have the amazing friends I have today, without your series, I'd never have met them. Seeing people slander you like this breaks my heart. You've been a role model to me for the past 7 years of my life, and I'm happy to say you still are. The fact that don't surrender to a bunch of people online is something not a lot of people would do, and that's admirable, to me. The threats they have sent you and your family are appalling, and the fact that they doxxed you is too much for anybody to be deserving of, regardless of what they've done. You didn't deserve this. Cancel culture really is the worst. I really appreciate everything you have done for this community, and for the world in general. Even if you don't post here again, or hell, even if you choose to retire, I will always remember you for the strong person you are. I hope things improve for you from here on out, and I really do hope your family is alright as well. Thank you for everything, man.",

You are a good loving man, you spend millions on chairity, made a game for a sick child, you helped out many people, you touched many people's hearts, you even worked with a Lesbian artist i'm pretty sure.

Actually, more than amazing, there's just too many words to describe you with, you're just that great! You have done so many amazing things, and while I may not support the Republican side, that doesn't matter, none of that matters.  This isn't a spot for political warfare, this is a spot for Five Nights at Freddy's, something that has brought people like me absolute joy, creativity, friends, and the like, and I will forever be grateful for FNaF and what it did for me. It has gotten me through tough times, it got me into collecting, it got me into things that have a deeper story, it got me into creating art, it gave me happiness when nothing else did, hell, it's become my biggest special interest/thing to hyperfocus on and I bet tons of other people, no matter who they are or even what they believe in, can say the same thing. No matter what happens, we are going to stick around, and we understand that you have a heart of gold, one that is purely unbeatable, and one that can be seen as an inspiration. I have nothing but massive respect for you Scott, I really do, and I don't want to even think about what life would have been if I never got into FNaF and if I never got to bear witness to one of the best people ever. God bless your soul, Mr. Cawthon, don't let anybody tear you or your family down, you're stronger than your foes. Thank you, Scott, thank you so much. You, along with your creations will hold a special place in my heart for a long time. Remember, you are loved and appreciated. \ud83d\udc99",

I believe you when you say you believe in every form of equality, but that still doesn\u2019t dismiss the fact that you donated to campaigns and people who want a certain group of people dead. And for those who say this is an exaggeration, it isn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re intentions are good. The unfortunate truth of the matter is, your intentions will never affect the way your donation will be spent. Indirect support is still that, support. I am not apart of the LGBTQA+ community myself, but I do have friends who are. Friends who have been affected by these injustices towards them. It honestly infuriates me that people are just willing to go \u201cIt\u2019s fine Scott, you\u2019re still my hero\u201d. You fail to realise the consequences his donations have. He may have donated the money with good intentions, but that does not dismiss the fact that that money still went to a dangerously harmful campaign to get rid of a certain group of people\u2019s rights. I don\u2019t hate you Scott, I rlly don\u2019t. I\u2019m glad that you were honest here, I\u2019m so glad you aren\u2019t the person people accused you of being, and I\u2019m so damn mad at the people who threatened you and your family\u2019s well being and wish you, your wife, and your kids nothing but the best. But please, do some research, educate yourself further of the campaigns and people you donate to. Your abundance of good deeds are never lost upon me and everyone else. All I ask is for you to be informed and see the true colors of the people you think are doing good for your country. And too everyone who jumped the gun and called him homophobic, transphobic, racist on Twitter: Stop living in that fucking bubble of yours where everything is all black and white. It isn\u2019t. Situations have complicated nuances to them, it isn\u2019t just \u201cGood or bad\u201d. Also, to the people who are calling out other people who are now uncomfortable spending money on the FNaF franchise: Please understand that it comes from a place of feeling uncomfortable giving money to a man who they think might just give it to the campaigns. It may not be the whole truth, but please respect them on that end either way. Also, never discredit the voices of the LGBTQA+ people who speak out against this. They have every right to be upset and mad about the situation.",

        "Comment": "Let me preface this by saying that the doxxing and death threats were completely unacceptable. I know a lot of people won't bother to read this if I don't start with that, especially since this is gonna be a lot. But Scott, you have to understand this: even if you supported these people for other reasons, you have to come to terms with the fact that you can't just pick and choose which parts of their platforms you support. Even if you only agree with one part of what they say, by supporting them, especially financially, you're supporting everything they stand for. The money you give them doesn't care why you're giving it to them. That money is going to be used for everything they stand for, including the parts that involve directly harming people. You need to understand that this is why people are upset. You can't say \"even if there were others who had better things to say about the LGBT community, but I felt they may have in actuality done more harm than good\" when the people you supported have actively and openly stated their stance is antagonistic. Choosing someone who is open about their hatred is not, in any circumstance, a better option than someone who says they will support but might do more harm than good. That's just not how this works. For everyone who's reducing this to \"a difference of opinion\" or that you \"don't care about politics\" other such things: you do not fully grasp the gravity of the situation, most likely because the consequences would not effect you. The policies that these people, especially Mitch McConnell, represent put actual people in real danger. If you can understand that the people who took this too far aren't just \"a difference of opinion,\" then you certainly have the mental capacity to understand that what happened here isn't either. You're just choosing not to. Imagine if he had supported people that might have great platforms on the economy, foreign policy, the works. Except they also openly and loudly hold policies that would directly harm you, your friends, your family, etc. You would rightfully be upset. Then imagine that everyone who chooses to support Scott either way dismissed your criticism as \"just a difference of opinion\". This is what you are doing. This is especially jarring coming from fellow LGBTQ fans. You are not special. They will come for you just as they come for everyone else. To tie this back into FNAF with a quote, you will not be spared. You will not be saved. At best, you will be used as an excuse for them to go \"look, we don't hate all of you!\" while they continue to do things that harm the rest of us and eventually you when you outgrow your usefulness. Please do not fall for it. I don't care whether you choose to continue to support Scott or not. What I do care about is that you understand why people are upset and not just scream \"cancel culture!!!\" when people attempt to hold someone accountable for the harmful things they do. Whatever Scott's intentions were, you have to understand that this support is going towards the anti-LGBTQ stances these people hold. They go towards the people that downplayed the Covid-19 pandemic and lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands. Even if he didn't intend for it, that's what happened and you need to understand that and you need to understand that that's why people are upset, especially when at least some of this money was from them purchasing his games. They were unintentionally and unknowingly funding the very people who want to erase them from existence and they have the right to be upset. Again, like I said, death threats and doxing are a step way too far. But to completely discredit the criticisms of everyone just because of them is unwise, especially when nearly everyone on both sides would agree that they were unacceptable.",

Giving this much money to these specific people was certainly a mistake, but all that really matters is your intention here.

Doxing you isn\u2019t just disrespectful, it\u2019s a full on crime, and I can\u2019t imagine how hard all this stuff must have been for you and your family.

I never want creators to be chased away from creating, and I respect that you have not ever used FNaF as a vehicle to portray your religious nor political beliefs. My primary concern is that my money is potentially going to the likes of Mitch McConnell, Ben Carson, etc who have enacted legislation that has actively worsened my life and the lives of those I love.  I will be buying used copies of your games from here onward, as my conscious does not sit happily knowing where my money ends up.  I hope you understand where I am coming from as a queer person. EDIT: I will say that I FIRMLY DISAPPROVE of doxxing and death threats being sent to your family. I am extremely empathetic - my mother has had many miscarriages and I understand secondhand the fear a parent has when it comes to possibly losing family in that regard. I'm sorry it happened, and I hope it stops immediately.",

        "Comment": "I made a comment here right after this response was released that expressed my gratitude for you here. But, being honest, it was so in the moment and out of pure shock and emotion, that I don't know if it's as genuine as I thought. I've done some thinking, and to be honest, I don't even know what to think anymore. While it is true that it seems you are against bigotry, be it homophobia, racism, transphobia, whatever, and I believe you in saying that... I don't see how supporting Mitch McConnell really reflects that at all. I mean, you say that you think the other side wants to do things even worse for the LGBT community, but you never specified what that means. And frankly, I'm starting to think you aren't being honest on that much, and that your reasons for voting and supporting the politicians that you do are more self-serving, for you and your family. Yet, at the same time, I know you aren't like that. Or at least, I don't think you are. You've donated millions to charities, you've always been kind to the community. And I do believe you aren't a bigot. But I will never understand what can be more important than the rights of others when voting for someone. But at the end of the day, whatever conclusion I come to, this community won't be the same without Scott Cawthon. So it seems my options are: stick with this franchise, but the original creator isn't even here anymore, or decide to leave, as because of one reason or another, nothing will be the same again. Again, apologies to your family for having to go through all of the fear and threats taking place right now. I don't think in any situation that's okay. And while I can empathize with you on that much, that doesn't mean I'm 100% for you here, because as I said, I just don't get it. Yes, I'm sure you don't agree with 100% of what these politicians believe, especially when it comes to Civil Rights matters. But the fact of the matter is, you still gave money to them and their anti-LGBT legislation, even if that's not where you wanted your money to go. And I don't know what could have been so important that you decided to give so much money to them, despite their homophobic or transphobic ideas. I just can't understand that. tl;dr. Can't decide what the hell to think about this anymore. But no matter what, this series won't be the same again, so I might just pack my bags and leave.",

Some people will still be upset or dislike you, and some will feel you can be forgiven. The fact of the matter is, I am very pleased to know that you didn't do this out of malice or out of distaste for any minorities, especially the LGBTQ+ community. I'm very glad to see that despite what some may believe based off your beliefs that you're a very accepting person, and it makes me happy to see how much you care about your fans. I'm deeply sorry that this drama caused you and your family any fear (especially with the doxxing part), but I'm happy to know that at the very least, you do care, and you never meant to harm anyone. While I do hope in the future you'll put a little more thought into how others will be affected by these sorts of donations, I am glad that you've apologized. Your apology is very clearly genuine, and from the heart; and with a situation like this, it takes guts to say anything at all. So thank you for saying this Scott. I hope everyone can learn from this situation and how we as a fanbase can better handle controversies, and how you as a creator can better connect with the minorities in the fanbase. At the end of the day, we're all human, and it's nice to see that you are so willing to put everything on the line just to say sorry about something that wasn't even our business in the first place. Anyways, I'm bad at ending text-based messages so I'll just leave it at a small message to my fellow fans: I hope we can all move forward, and even if you don't forgive him, at least acknowledge that he does care.",

But there is a difference between supporting some run of the mill candidate and supporting ones that specifically want those who are \"different\" dead. I've been a fan since the day the first game came out, and I'm still a fan, but I do find it kinda cringe, especially considering with Trump he left millions of people for dead in regards to the pandemic. And his vice president supports abuse and forced conversion therapy for lgbt youth. It's just a lot of mixed signals and I just don't understand people who value the economy over actual life, what's the pro-life in that?",

Nobody deserves to be getting threats so I'll get that out of the way, but also... you're directly funding politicians trying to legislate bills that hurt LGBT people. As a trans person watching heinous new anti-LGBT laws going into effect across the country, right now, that's really hard to reconcile. How can I support someone who is not just allowing but enabling - actively, financially supporting - everything I stand against? You're actively hurting so many of the LGBT kids who look up to you and adore what you've created by donating to republican, anti-LGBT lawmakers. You're making the future worse for them. I don't know how you can SEE what republicans are doing to the LGBT community across the US and not realize that.",

However, I feel like you cannot say you support your LGBT fans or minorities in your fan base if you still actively donate to people who want to get rid of our rights. Mitch McConnell was the most shocking donation to me, and the fact Scott donated the max he could was most surprising. Just a simple Google search tells you how McConnell feels about us. I will always defend your right to be a Republican and any other opinions you may hold, but ONLY if they don't harm others. You can't use voting for a Democrat as proof that you support other opinions if you still support lawmakers who actively harm this community. You have created an amazing franchise that brought me so so much joy while I was struggling in college. I don't want you to just leave this community, but I also want you to take your fans' disappointment to heart and not ignore it by just leaving the platform entirely. These are people that buy your games and love them, people that have made a whole community and fan base about how much they adore this franchise. We just want you to see how supporting lawmakers like this can actively hurt us and our rights as people. I'm sorry this had to happen, but not addressing other concerns is a huge issue.",

Regardless of how much I disagree with your stance, and how the rest of my post will sound, nobody should face that. Genuinely, I wish you and your family the best, and I hope the doxxing and threats end. With that said, I'm really disappointed by your post. I understand how some people were mislead by Trump. What I don't understand is how you can still support someone like him after you saw how terrible of a person he was during his tenure. You've never said or denounced anything about how much damage Trump did to our democracy, our LGBTQ friends, to people's lives in regards to how he handled the pandemic, and hundreds of other reasons. You still supported that man and his cronies that held him up. You've also donated to some of the most vile and evil politicians this country has ever seen. Mitch McConnell is somehow worse than Trump and doesn't even try to hide it, yet you actually made a financial donation to it. You allude to supporting Kimberly Klacik and Tulsi Gabbard, but don't mentioned that you financially donated and support evil people like McConnell, Nunes, Stefanik, etc. If you support their platforms, that's fine, but own up to it.  You have to go out of your way to donate to these people. I'm a republican. I'm a Christian. I'm pro-life. I believe in God. I also believe in equality, and in science, and in common sense. Despite what some may say, all of those things can go together. That's not an apology or promise to change, it's the way it's always been. None of those things apply to Trump besides him being pro-life. The guy has five children with three different wives. One of which he cheated on with a porn star while she was pregnant. He openly denied and mocked science, and as a result the US did horrible when it came to covid-19. You are either completely brainwashed and blinded by whatever media you consume, or you genuinely support all of these beliefs that the republican platform stands for. If it's the former, please educate yourself more and seek better news coverage.",

If you decide to never interact with the community again, the majority of us people who have common sense and don't call for blood due to diffrent beliefs will miss you greatly, in fact those who hate you for your beliefs will slowly notice it's not the same either. I have been in this fandom since the beginning, and i have never told anyone this, but I'm trans and nearly picked Cawthon as my middle name because i want to be like you in the sense that you always try to do the right thing (I finally settled on Henry as a first name seeing as he's a character you created). The people who nosed into your personal info had no right too, it's disgusting. I myself have had this same sort of thing happen to be for the past six years and i know how scary the feeling of being hunted feels. I am not shocked by your beliefs, but just know I like people who try to do the right thing and follow their own heart, not people who have my same beliefs down to a T or follow the crowd. I have also decided to dedicate my first novel to you along with other amazing people, you are the person who got me into writing and back into the art world. I also strongly know for a fact, and this is something that other people should know, is that you would never do anything to purposefully harm others. You aren't out to get anyone. I truly wish you the best in life and hope everything turns out okay, these are upsetting and sensitive times. ~Henry",

Those at the top it\u2019s almost like a sickness it\u2019s all about the shareholders and making profit. Never about the people. I worked for a company long ago that had a yearly meeting ever worker went to . In the meeting the ceo said last year we made our biggest profit ever 30 million dollars . (Small/medium fabrication factory. ) Next year we want it to be 40 million. That is the problem with the current system in place it will never be good enough . It could be a 30 million profit or a 30 billion profit they will still look to make more and screw people over in the process. Their workers work full time for them and still have to get government help . But they made double the profit as last year!!! To double up on the problems the corporations basically run everything now so it\u2019s very hard to fight against it. Fuck the workers , fuck the people , fuck the planet it doesn\u2019t matter as long as they make profit.",

I'm going through the same thing and thankfully getting by with, \"Waiting on an official fix from Microsoft\". Not sure how long this will last without hearing from them but some random articles suggest Cyber attack and others like this thread suggest bad updates. I see everyone bypassing anti-malware and I'm still hesitant to even give that a whirl in an abundance of caution. Anyone else else on the same boat and can counter with a more concrete response besides what OP is saying. I do believe it's on the right track but why is disabling the anti-malware the first thing that comes to mind as a good workaround? Thanks!",

Hotfix to be released asap to strip out the offending 2022-serial number sig files. Temp workaround is to add a 13th month to 2021 for the signatures - i.e. the next sig after 211231nnnn will be 211301nnnn. So welcome to the 13th month of 2021! Edit: Looks like they preferred to go with the 33rd day of December - i.e. 2112330001. Interesting ... only 2 months to fix it if you do this, i.e. before 211299nnnn. Unless they choose to iterate the nnnn in a different manner.",

I spent from 11:30-12:30 looking into reports of mail not going out; fortunately for my org, we're entirely on o365, but just have internal servers to act as mail relay for stuff generated by on-prem systems...  but still - on just one of our 10ish exchange boxes, i saw 400+ mails queued by 1a.  I haven't personally dealt with Exchange issues in literally years... once every 10 weeks on-call, and we almost never get exchange related issues.. geez",

They believe in survey results, in graphs, numbers that represent people's decisions and ideas. They feed their mind with information validated outside of their heads. For them, if results of different surveys or information seem accurate to lots of people, these results are accurate too. They don't stop and internally process if the information seems reasonable inside their heads. They dont validate it internally. They just accept it. Ti: Ti users, in contrast to Te users, rely heavily on what makes sense to themselves, Internally. They dont tend to trust outside sources that much. That's the reason of the \"arguing\" stereotype of xntp's. Ti's tend to make up their own theories and opinions, while Te's opinions are more of a \"collection\" and average of other trusted people's opinions. Of course I'm not saying Te's can't think \"originally\" and not copy, just that their main source of information is other people and outside sources. Makes sense to me from what I've observed and experienced.",

If we want an in-universe explanation, Piltover and Zaun is a central port region where many immigrants came from around Runeterra. Viktor's family could have come from anywhere to end up there, explaining the accent.",

I think it makes sense they didn't want the website to actually exist or have products while making a commentary on the people who went to the website about the same \"consumerist capitalist bullshit during a pandemic\" Rick was talking about. They just bought the domain because Rick & Morty is huge and if they didn't, someone else would buy the domain to sell their own fucking bullshit while coasting on the fandom.  Which is funny because denying other people the opportunity to do business or taking advantage of your IP is also hyper-capitalistic by itself lol.",

Knowing how cute their first meeting was (Venti coming to visit, Zhongli preparing to come to his aid, turned out Venti just wanted to hang out and thus leading to the tradition of the Archons' drinking party in Liyue) I really want to see them reunited again. I feel like Zhongli can really let loose with Venti given how he sounded describing Venti as opposed to his generally well-composed tone. Pretty sure he misses him according to the osmanthus wine line too, together with the other original Sevens. I hope the \" wind \" will return to Liyue again someday. Losing his peers one by one until he remained all alone, ultimately leading to that decision he made to step down after persevering for so long... it'd do both of them good to see each other again, reliving the olden days. Sorry for the word vomit, I've been thinking about them the past few days and just... all the feels. Thank you so much for the gorgeous artwork. I love your original design for Zhongli's attire, and they both look beautiful in your style! <3",

        "Comment": "Scary how a lot of them are already clearly developing. The only reason why this is not immediately apparent in the same way as the cold war was is becouse China just buys nations instead of using  military pressure. So its less of a cold military war but more a cold economic war. But a large conflict none the less. The internet. It was supposed to revolution the way the world communicates and would bring everyone together. In reality its used as a weapon to sow internal conflict and undermine progress. Right now it made people a lot of money, but it may very well be the cause of the next depression if not brought under control. Wrong, but only becouse they picked the wrong things for Russia to devolve into. If they were just going to say its not a liberal democracy. It would be correct. Nailed it down perfectly. Eastern and western Europe are two completely different areas with extremely different ideas. This fracture may prove to much to heal. In the best case scenario we see the return of the Iron curtain with a liberal democracy on the west and a far right authoritarian regime on the right. But a collapse of Europe with various new conflicts can in the long run not be ruled out. Not yet. But if nothing is done, its just a matter of when this one starts. Sort of. While the average person is not scared of being blown up. Terrorism is going mainstream as a method in political debates. With threatening aggressive actions seen more and more as a justifiable means of protest and defended by politicians when they see fit. Its not do what I say or we will blow up another school. But more do what I say or we will disrupt national transportation or riot. Smaller scale acts of terrorism like burning down buildings are also becoming more common as a result of this. While the hospitals are not overrun with cancer. Pollution is starting to make large impacts on city planning with housing projects or roads being disrupted by concerns of negative health effects. Its not a case where being to late is causing the disruptions. But our efforts to prevent this just not being free of economic consequences. Check. Europe went through a mayor gas crisis a few months ago with prices doubling in just a few weeks time and fuel jumping 50 cents per liter. Things have stabilized now, but the effects still haven't fully hit the consumer yet. The political rammifications of being this dependent on Russian gas for a while also arent clear yet. The number was just a guess so may prove to be wrong. But its undeniable a near perfect prediction of Corona. You just have to look at backlash towards measures to combat climate change, obesity, Corona or other mayor issues to see this one in action.",

        "Comment": "My impression is that the list goes always a bit too far in its scenarios, but still things going in all those directions did happen. While relations with China are indeed not good, overall they seem far from a cold war, let alone a hot one, with the markets still relying strongly on China and all. The advent of smartphones and social media, and the detrimental role these technologies have played in mental health and politics could apply. But it's not like there was a big technological failure or anything, outside of maybe too much wide-eyed optimism regarding what the Internet would be socially. Russia did not become a democratic country, and it is working on annexing some territories, but it's not to the extent that it threatens Europe. The European Union's original momentum has slowed down, but it did achieve a union of most stable European countries. Climate change has continued to become a bigger problem, though not in the way the article thinks. There was no major rise of terrorism, but the effect was achieved nonetheless in the US and Europe with great success, thanks to just a few key, incredibly traumatic events. Pollution remains a big problem, but only the poor actually suffer from it. The health system however, was indeed ill-prepared to face other problems. There was no new energy crisis. The Middle East has problems though, but they didn't result in an energy crisis. Turns out, it wasn't even necessary to get a terrible plague for the world's healthcare systems to crack... There is undeniably a reactionary movement in the West. Is it going to send us back to the dark ages though? That seems unlikely, as it could also be the last gasps of a dying system. But time will tell.",

        "Comment": "So.... professional forecaster here. I get paid to make forecasts on future events for a company called Good Judgment. Feel free to research it and join the Open Competition if you can. In order to get invited to join the professional team you have to finish in the top ten in the world (out of tens of thousands of forecasters) over a year or so. One of the main items in any forecast is the question has to have a specific criteria for resolution, in a specific time frame, and specific wording that is not ambiguous. Every single one of these potential items fails all of the criteria. So none of these would even be acceptable questions for us to forecast. Why? Because every one could be subjectively answered as True or False at virtually any time with no cut off. Look at the China/US cold war one. A true question we might get at GJ would be \"will there be a military fatality of a US soldier caused by the Chinese army by 1/1/22.\" Specific criteria, over a specific time with no ambiguity for resolution. The \"technology is a bust\" is atrocious, and not even anything close to specific or unambiguous. Some are routine parts of the cycle of the world (famines for example). When you have people that live in non-arable swaths of land famines happen. Especially when dictators control the food supply. I could go through every one, and will if anyone cares. But reading the comments it is clear to me that everyone reads the ambiguity in the questions and resolves them however they see fit. It's exactly what charlatans and psychics do.",

        "Comment": "Cannabis is a very emotional subject for many, so people do extreme things to either protect or ban it. From what I have read, most doctors agree that cannabis has beneficial medical uses but the dosage and side effects have not conclusively been tested to a medical standard. Of course the only way to get that testing is to do the tests but there is little financial gain to be had by large companies to test a product that is already freely available. A full medical trial is incredibly expensive and with such political conflagration, it is a struggle to even propose such tests. Ideally, simply allowing it as an alternative medicine (as is now slowly happening) will bring the drugs into the mainstream & therefore give a greater and more varied test group but without strict reporting of results this won't produce any usable data. I don't feel that any big drug company is blocking cannabis based medicine so much as they simply don't see a good return on investment. They could spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a trial to make a product that everyone could just make their own version of straight away as the active ingredients are already known. Especially since those drugs already exist in one form or another.",

        "Comment": "\"...based on patient-reported data...\" makes this a little unconvincing. I definitely have seen a good deal or convincing literature supporting the benefits of cannabis for a variety of conditions. From my personal experience, as someone who suffers from chronic pain, I am confident that cannabis can be extremely effective at treating pain. I also have seen it improve opiate cessation and reduce the associated withdrawal symptoms. All that being said, any patient-reported study needs to be supported by further research. The sample size here is impressive, but I still want to keep a bit of skepticism.",

        "Comment": "Note that NTR is primarily a hentai/porn category. What often gets missed with NTR, and why it's different from cheating. Is that the target for the NTR and the person you're meant to identify with is the main character, so it's far closer to \"cuckolding\" than cheating. The whole purpose of it is that the sex/cheating is done in a way specifically to insult/degrade the main relationship, it's meant to instill the reader with anguish, anger, pain and such. So for example a cheating story would be something like the a lonely housewife falling for a young man that's moved into her appartment and them begining an affair. Can be NTR, but it's fairly mild. An NTR story would be an office worker bringing his boss back home with him for dinner, them getting drunk together, him passing out and the boss then co-ercing his wife into having sex with him in their bed, which she then loves and gets hooked on. It would then transition to things like the wife sucking the boss off at work under his desk, or having sex with him in the next room, all those kind'a things. The core aspect is that the guy is oblivious to it, but the wife and the boss are having sex in a way that's practically taunting him with their affair. You'd expect things like it to be repeatedly pointed out that the boss is a better lover, that he's got a bigger dick, that the wife doesn't care about her husband anymore. Probably will end with the wife pregnant and the husband raising another man's child. You've got similar stories for anything else, childhood friend being fucked while the guy she loves can't quite work up the courage to confess, etc etc. Think of it as romance destruction. It's meant to make the reader upset. It's not meant to be a pleasant thing. But with it being such a mainstream idea now, the term's been thrown around a lot and loses a lott'a meaning, then you have people saying things like \"It's fine, I self insert as the bad guy!\" which goes against the whole point of it.",

Its genre where MC/FMC will get mentally and/or physically destroyed but some dick/slut who doesnt give shit about them and will cheat them with all kind of people (could be  only one) and disrespect FMC/MC.  In end FMC/MC would walk in room and see their wife/gf/bf/gf/husband fuck with other person. ntr manga: <H-mate> <Drug candy> </Blush-DC.> (this one have good story for NTR) <Household affairs> (this one is not HC because it starts right away IMO) If you want real NTR stuff then I suggest to go to hentai sites (can recommend those too xD) and see what ntr means xD",

        "Comment": "I personally don't hate ntr, I personally don't hate any plot device. I think all could be used amazingly well but also horribly wrong. First the proper meaning of NTR is when the protagonist partner whom they are DATING is taken away from them, so yeah cheating. But over time people started overgeneralising the word to love triangles or even when girl has never noticed MC before but starts dating someone else. Why? because ntr has a more negative connotation to it. (Not advocating for anything but it's the best example i can think of)  Paedophilia, it means attraction to prepubescent kids, but the word has been generalised to include anyone under 17 to get a more negative response. It's just a thing humans do, there so many words that have been overgeneralised with it's negative connotation. Although i won't say that it's the only reason. Well some people like to self insert themselves into the protagonist shoes, so if the protagonist has a harem, they have a harem.(probably why harem anime/manga has a stable market) So when the girl is taken away from the MC she's taken away from them, and of course they won't like that. So same thing now starts to happen in situations that have been generalised under ntr, they are already unconsciously having a negative reaction to it. Now the problem with real NTR is that it has been used lazily most of the time. I really haven't seen a manga where i saw ntr and didn't feel like it wasn't forced.",

Ntr (as a whole) is a form of plot focused onto describe the manner in which a character is deprived of something he/she treasures; being this something as concrete as a partner or merely abstract as a friendship or its sense of trust. In regular manga NTR is not synonim of cheating, instead, is used as drama fuel aimed to problematize the emotional (usually romatic) relationship between two or more actors, and usually do not have further consecuences. Menwhile in Hentai manga NTR is used as representation of cheating, betrayal or infidelity, and it's always a consequence.",

The difference is in whom you you are meant to empathize with: the person being cuckolded in the case of netorare, and the person 'stealing' the partner in the case of netori. Netorare tends to have a lot of superficial hate towards it because it's meant to make you feel shitty with heavy emotional effect and so on, so it's not something a lot of people want to read. There's also the issue that it's poorly used to make some lots of truly terrible hentai.",

She\u2019s still a child, driven to the brink of madness and beyond by her experiences with the cult, including the experimentation and being sold off to a Brothel, so it probably brought out the protective instincts in a lot of them. The D G Cult is so horrific we know that thousands of children were kidnapped, enslaved and experimented upon, but only 3 of them are known to have survived. Given how Arianrhod treats Ennea (another survivor) like a daughter, and she\u2019s the big moral good of the society, I can see most of them having at least protective instincts over a girl who\u2019s still a child that\u2019s broken enough to only exist as an enforcer until someone finally is able to reach out. Don\u2019t forget there\u2019s no reprisal when she leaves to join Josh, or when (CS4 spoilers) Spoiler alert. Click to see",

I'll go a bit offtopic on this and say that knowing what SEO has managed to search results, I feel that we are some times in echo chambers or circle jerks when trying to discover new things or search. Maybe it's a confirmation bias but when I didn't know about SEO (and maybe SEO wasn't as important) it felt that content was more varied and interesting. Now it's all a cookie cutter mold that is formed out of top tens tips/ways. In conclusion I feel that people that were passionate about a niche either died or had to change their content to survive and remain relevant and stay afloat.",

Here is a screenshot of the Original post on bilibili , and it is saying: Under Venti's statues in Mondstadt, there's these wording translated into \"the gateway of Celestia\" We all know from the game that the 7 archon Gnosis were given by Celestia to the chosen ones, and it is resonate directly with the Celestia. But adding on top of this wording under Venti Statues, can we also assume that for mortals to physically go to Celestia, one must possess a Gnosis? If that's true, then no wonder why all the past fallen nation, such as the Dragonspine and Khaenri'ah, did not stand a chance against the punishment from Celestia. They can't even go to Celestia for counter-attack because they do not have Gnosis, and even if they somehow manage to get one, only that one person who possess the Gnosis can go. But what can one man do against the entire Godly nation?",

So I don't get this one. Going by the post, a correction could be: Surge, vir fortis, pete fatam victoram \"Rise, hero, search/go for the destined victory\". Sumeru: Sub floreis lumen sagacitatis (Under flower is the light of wisdom) *floreis is not a word in latin but it could be a contracted for of sub flore est which makes sense Fontaine: Iustitia omnia vincit (Justice conquers all) Snezhnaya: Ducam regina mea gloria haud pluribus impar (?) *this sentence is weird in general (nothing fits together) but here is my take on it anyway: Afferam reginae meae gloriam haud pluribus maiorem \"I will bring such glory to my queen, there shall be few which can compare to it.\"  -  this is a very \"expanded\" translation, but it gets the point across. Ex culmine lucis, in magno elementorum (From the peak of light, in the greatness of elements) Ad virtutem (towards/to virtue/courage) Nullum magnum ingenium fortitudoque\u00a0sine mixture\u00a0fortunae fuere *while it does have some meaning, the words are all over the place so I took the liberty to tidy this one up: Nullum magnum ingenium nec ullus fortis sine mixtura fortunae fuit. \"No great wisdom nor anyone strong ever existed without a bit of luck\"",

The directions are meant to align with that of the 4 winds - Eurus, Notus, Zephyrus, and Boreas - which have an association to the 4 bodies: Mental, Astral, Etheric, and Physical. It's also worth noting \"the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram is associated with the elements (fire, water, air, earth).",

I was able to keep my faculties enough to tell them something wrong, so my parents picked me up and we left my truck there. Got to the hospital, and my BP was so high they couldnt even move me from the ER, and were surprised i was conscious. They took me back for a spinal tap finally, even though the BP was still high, and it immediately dropped my BP. Turns out i have a disease called IIH or PTC.

Six months later I still get blurriness when I\u2019m tired. I guess pontine strokes are very different to strokes in the cortex though. The pons is basically like an information highway, and most of my symptoms are a result of disrupted communication between the nerves in my body and my brain (balance problems, nerve pain, numbness, etc). I\u2019m lucky though - damage to the pons can cause Locked In Syndrome where you can\u2019t speak or move at all except for small up/down eye movements while the rest of your brain works perfectly normally. That\u2019s terrifying.",

        "Comment": "I think there are some possible reasons for perceived overlap between these two: As introverted processes, they are not as in your face as other functions. I think that they sometimes co-occur. That is, an Ni perception occurs, and Ti may be needed to justify it. \"Well, they wouldn't have said this, if they meant this.\" I believe that's Ti *logic*, but the logic is used to justify something unseen to the observer, a perception that has come from nowhere. Ni My understanding of Ni is that primarily involves \"insights\" that occur spontaneously and passively guide the user. The mystical and psychic sound of this is the source of much confusion around Ni. Someone recently explained it well saying Ni is most often unspectacular (as are most things in life). The insights that tend to arise are often about mundane things rather than a constant influx of grandiose insights about the cosmos. Ti I think the ultimate question of Ti is whether A makes sense given B. Ti users are the people who don't like it when a board game's play doesn't match its story. They want consistency.",

        "Comment": "Ti defines and refines. Ni watches and observes. Ti is active. Ni is passive. If your mind feels overly active, you\u2019re probably a Ti type.  If you feel like the world is overly active, and you struggle to keep up with how fast things change around you, you\u2019re likely Ni. Thinking types in general see the world as a medium of static interactions. If a=a and b=b, and a+b=c, then b+a=c and c=b+a. Under the same circumstances, the same things happen over and over again. That\u2019s why science is what it is. Intuition types see the world as a singular entity flowing and changing and melding.  It tries to get a grip on how the world flows without applying principles to it.  It watched for patterns. The difference, I think, is how close these functions are to your sensations.  In Ti, everything is hyper-abstracted to the point of malleability, and these malleable abstractions (such as numbers for example) point to specific universal behaviors of objects, like in the case of mathematics. In Ni, the abstractions of your environment are stored similarly, however, there is no manipulation applied.  It watches the world for what it is and doesn\u2019t attempt to attach ideas to what it sees (that\u2019s Ne), instead it tries to focus very hard on what the thing actually is: the way it behaves.",

        "Comment": "Thanks for making this! I live in Japan and see the stage plays in person but I always want to help people around the world get to know about them and see them and love them~(I missed this last one because I went to see SQS instead, that's another series from the same producer, and Freddy and Mike were in that one, which is why they weren't in this.) A couple of notes... Sharing the play in public is prohibited and against japan stageplay rules I mean, it's not so much a community rule as it is... you know... copyright law. I guess Westerners just play more fast and loose with these things, and Broadway seems to be more tolerant of the \"slime tutorials\", at least for now, but like... the majority of Western creators don't want their stuff pirated and reposted any more than Japanese creators do, it's just that Japanese fans actually care, Western artists sort of have no choice but to let everyone get away with it. It's just... this shouldn't be news to anyone. *cough* that aside... It's also a good idea for anyone that's interested to follow the production's official twitter, https://twitter.com/identityV_stage - They haven't announced any more plays yet, but considering that Double Down sold out more performances at Tachikawa Stage Garden (over twice the number of seats as Hulic) than SQS Machine Elements did at Hulic the same week, I'd be surprised if Movista at least isn't willing. I'm guessing they'll do more, they're just waiting to solidify more details before they announce anything. In any case, follow their twitter to hear about it first. - They tweet (and RT from the actors) all sorts of cute content around characters' birthdays/commemoration days and things like that, as well as information about the blurays, trailers and such. - Also follow the actors! Check the official twitter, especially their \"following\" list to find their twitter accounts. You might find that they've been in other series you like! Outside of Movista series, I know Hirai Yuki (Aesop) was Gojyo in the Saiyuki musicals recently, and both Suzuki Yota (Victor) and Agata Goki (Wujiu) have been in Haikyuu, maybe others too. Isono Dai (Andrew) has been in Touken Ranbu, but I don't know about any of the others... And Movista's Youtube https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTTHDzXr53fd-pgiuvfPBcA/videos which has official trailers and song previews. It also has information about their original series, Kuro to Shiro (which is about angels and demons) and their newly announced Zoo-Z (which is about... animal people... yeah, we'll see), both of which feature a lot of the same actors. About 80% of what Movista produces is in the Tsukipro series, but that has its own Youtube channel. I actually don't have the blurays, but I'd totally host a livestream party if I did... *cough* if anyone is interested in getting into Tsukipro, I'd totally have a livestream of Tsukipro plays I'd recommend to IDV fans (Romeo in the Darkness side Blue, Tsukino Empire)... That's all I can think of... when the pandemic stuff goes away and people can travel internationally, it'd be good to have a guide to buying tickets... maybe they'll tour internationally. They probably will, at least around Asia. (Honestly, they might have planned something like that, and revising those plans might be part of why they aren't ready to announce the next things yet. It's possible that there really won't be any more, but...).",

And you're talking about a weirdo fringe of sims players. People like that have been making rape/pedophilia/bestiality mods for Sims games for decades and Maxis/EA never stepped in or turned off mods. Why would they start now?

(and honestly, not a lawyer, but i would guess that they only did this to deflect lawsuits or they had some legal liability to prevent reeves' likeness from being misused.) whether or not game companies have a moral liability to step in and shut down a mod in this situation is a totally different debate. personally, i would deplatform every pedo i could, but i am not a video game company with video game company money to spend and video game company shareholders to please. and, if we're being real here, the absolute cheapest option for EA here is to have a blanket statement saying they have no liability for user-created content and then keeping their laissez-faire approach to modding. this is what most companies with mod-friendly games wind up doing. it's degenerate as hell but there's almost no chance it would cause EA to about-face on its stance on modding.",

My question is: From a legal/technical standpoint, how could this even be achieved? I think the issue is that you wouldn't be able to find evidence about these sorts of activities (especially not whether people actually downloaded it or not) unless you snooped around in people's computers. Which, to be fair, EA already does \u2013 but from my understanding, they can only access data that comes from the game itself (aka statistics about players' \u201cvanilla game habits\u201d), not whatever you do outside of the game's unmodded constraints. Thus, to collect data on what people do this sort of stuff, they'd have to either a) dig further into specific people's gaming habits or b) expand their data on EVERY player. The first alternative runs the risk of targeting innocent people, and the second, well, is simply invading privacy because of a minority of people doing dumb shit. I think that EA, unfortunately, considers the risk of losing a lot of money from upsetting players (and, for most of us, being upset would be reasonable) as outweighing whatever they would gain from doing such a drive. Again: I'm not defending this behavior, I'm just mentioning the issues I think EA sees with how one would go about eliminating this sort of content from the CC market. Which is a shame but also a sign of the times we live in, I guess.",

The most they did from what I can remember is banning mentions/links on their official forums and forcing the creator of WW to rename the mod, as they did not want it to look like they endorsed it. Unless there is a loud enough public outcry, I doubt EA will step in, but if they do, they should be able to let specific mods be taken down. I think there's greater harm from EA's perspective in banning all mods and CC together than in pretending like the most disgusting of mods do not exist or fall under the \"EA does not prescreen modifications and custom content. Use cautiously and at your own risk!\". Thing is, I am pretty sure people will find ways to get around EA trying to limit modding, since there are people taking walks through the game code and files that you are not really supposed to open. It would just be harder... I hope. Since we are talking about modifications to a videogame, I do not know if these are, strictly speaking, illegal (by God, I hope they are) -- even so, EA could (and in my opinion has the responsibility to do so) take actions against the creators of this (e.g. force host sites to take it down). But yeah, there absolutely exist ways for EA to take action without taking action against modders and CC creators in general. Likely, not all modifications that should be banned would be found, but at least some. Eventh\u00f4 this ruined my evening, thank you for bringing it to attention.",

This is common practice for Chinese companies to have a company outside of China handle their global operations as sort of a proxy/shell company and usually based in Singapore. Tencent, for instance, has Proxima Beta as their version of this.",

        "Comment": "Does anybody here actually do Market Research before they start there businesses? One person proposed the idea for taking on Amazon with the very thing Amazon had launched a year prior. Another proposed the idea of an alarm so you don't leave your stuff behind, unaware these have been used by parents on wandering children for years. Still others didn't want the discouragement of developing a product that had to compete with existing business, then faced the discouragement of launching an inferior product against superior alternatives. Then there are several dozens who only think they were doing research with surveys whose results promised big money but delivered, and I kid you not, zero sales. Is market research necessary start a business or do you just go with your assumptions? No. Not necessary at all. Depending on what bizarro world definition you concoct for the word Necessary. How do you do your research before starting? When makers of a famous brand of pancake syrup watched what customers actually did, they found them angling in their syrup bottles to awkwardly fit them into the microwave for warming. They developed a short, squat bottle which boosted sales. Then the second part of the test was to have an accountant suggest they drop the more expensive bottle, which dropped sales and caused negative backlash. A would-be restaurateur wanted to figure out if a jewish delicatessen worked in San Francisco. They started with a market experiment called a pop up, a temporary very small scale test even cheaper than a food truck. The next stage would be using the food truck to scout locations for a sit down location. And only then launch the fixed location. I ate at something similar and they seem to be thriving. No most people do not do any form of market research and those who make the attempt set up terribly flawed techniques for the purpose of getting confirmation bias -- something which they can rig to get the go ahead regardless of market demand. Why do you ask?",

A business is basically convincing someone to pay you for something (product or service) and getting paid enough that you can deliver profitably. Guessing you will get paid enough, without doing research, is a very bad idea. You should do as much as you can to minimise risk.",

        "Comment": "Not an expert but this is what I did for my business. I went into business because I noticed a certain type of store running on archaic practices causing frustrations and liabilities.  And as I went around Southern California I noticed this was not an anomaly but a trend. My market research includes talking to \"the boots on the ground\" at these stores on what makes their jobs so difficult, or what is an undue burden in the 21st century.  Then I asked the management these same questions. Now I have a list of ways my product can help these businesses - it's a rather long list.  While the niche industry I service is still fairly new (you could say it started in 1996...) there's still a bunch of competitors that I have that do what I do (management/POS). So now I did market research on my competitors, what makes them great, what makes them awful, and what makes my target market avoid them.  All of my competitors operate in the cloud, which poses a lot of issues for these specific businesses, and that is why a lot of these clinics do not wish to adopt these solutions. So I make my solution local to the clinic; and not in the cloud.  Nobody else does this, it is what sets me apart from my competition, and it will be quite difficult for my competition to get this right if they try (Vizio and Samsung can't even get Embedded Linux right...) tl;dr know the problems you're going to solve before going into business.  There's no one solid answer for how to go about finding this information out; all industries are different and will require their own type of market research.",

        "Comment": "I'm not an expert, but here are my thoughts. To an extent you obviously want to take some time to scope out the landscape of where you're aiming to launch, but it's really easy to spend months on it, and never getting around to building stuff. Ultimately \"market research\" is an evolving concept that will change as the market changes with consumer behavior. After getting a general sense of the problem you want to solve (talk to people have the problem, and get their thoughts...) you want to start rapid-prototyping different solutions, and stress testing in them in real-time. As you learn what does and dosen't work, you refine your value proposition, grow your expertise, and develop more effective solutions. That gives you a competitive advantage, and that's how you stay profitable. Disclaimer: This isn't something I've ever successfully done; I'm just rephrasing what I've heard people way smarter than me say.",

The key is to always be making progress and moving forward. You don't have to know everything before you start.",

CN will have changes to default outfits designs in accordance with regulations when 2.4 goes live (separate from the alternate outfits above). They will no longer have access to the current default outfit design of mona, jean, amber, rosaria. This is why they are getting 1200 primogems compensation. Global will NOT get this primogems compensation because global will keep the current default outfit design. Translation of CN Hoyolab post by u/seikuu : Beloved travelers:We are sorry to announce that in order to comply with relevant regulation, we will be adjusting certain aspects of game performance and characters during the 2.4 version update on January 5th as well as the later 2.5 version update. We sincerely apologize for any inconveniences caused by this sudden change. 2.4 version update info (1) Adjusted Jean, Amber, Rosaria and Mona\u2019s appearance (2) Adjusted the game perspective while gliding 2.5 update info (1) We will adjust the in-game art of Jean, Amber, Rosaria and Mona (2) We will adjust the appearance of Jean, Amber, Rosaria and Mona in cutscenes We are deeply aware of the love and care travelers have for game characters, and understand that players will not be happy with such a sudden change. The production team will redesign the default outfits of Jean, Amber, Rosaria and Mona using their current outfits as basis, and will distribute the new default outfits via the in-game outfit system. The current designs for the outfits are as follows: (image) This image is for reference only, please see the final result in the game after it is deployed Information on when the outfits will be released will be released soon, any and all changes will be revealed to travelers at earliest notice. Compensation 1200 primogems Timeframe of compensation 6 am on January 5, 2022, for all travelers above AR5 Within 5 hours of the 2.4 version update, the production team will send all travelers an in-game mail with the compensation. The mail is valid for 30 days, which is before the end of version 2.4. We are aware that this compensation is insufficient to appease the regrets of all travelers, but at this time this is all we can do. We once again extend our deepest apologies to all travelers. Finally, we would like to thank all travelers for supporting and understanding us, and for caring and spending time on Genshin Impact Also, due to its relevance to the topic and the nature of these design changes, discussion related to politics (specifically the guidelines upon which Mihoyo are making these changes) will be allowed here. So don't bother reporting political discussion relating to these changes for violating Rule 5.",

We don\u2019t know and I\u2019m sure Chinese players aren\u2019t happy about this forced censorship either.",

        "Comment": "I find it disheartening that many people on this sub happy about the censorship on the CN server. To start off, the new covered-up outfit/skins for characters will only be forced on Chinese server due to Mihoyo having to comply with regulation of the Chinese government as the CCP is heavily cracking down on Chinese entertainment. On the global servers for Genshin, the covered-up outfits will only be released as an optional skin. With time, the forced use of covered-up skin will likely be forced on Global like how it is in China. Mihoyo's other game, Honkai Impact, was later censored in the Global version following the censoring in the China version. More importantly, the future character designs of Genshin will likely be compromised as we People who like the covered-up designs and dislike people who prefer fan-service designs are either cheering or happy for the change, for they think that Mihoyo's future character designs will tailor more to their liking despite Mihoyo's loss of creative freedom due to having to comply to the CCP regulation. Of course, there is nothing wrong with liking covered-up designs. As an individual who likes fan service, I liked both revealing and covered-up designs in numerous video games, but a certain group of people who think censorship is right or good as long as it gives them what they like is making me feel disheartened. The group of people praising the censorship are saying that Mihoyo never even had much creative freedom before the CCP regulation and the forced change because Mihoyo always had to restrict themselves to fan service based designs. However, that claim is not true. Mihoyo had creative freedom before the regulation to make both fans service or non fanservice based designs. Mihoyo had more fan serviced designs in Genshin because they themselves liked to, not concern of profits. The popular, official phrase next to Mihoyo is always: \"Tech Otakus Save the World\". Otakus are people who like fan service/sexualized anime based designs. If you look up the founder of Mihoyo, the people who started Mihoyo are enthusiastic in fan service themselves. Mihoyo can make just as much money they currently have like the western companies with non-sexualized or non fan service designs. But the reason they still focused on fan service designs is because they themselves liked it. The founder of Mihoyo is a part of the Otaku culture. To Mihoyo, preserving Otaku culture can sometimes be more important than money. The only thing stopping Mihoyo from making fan-service design is the Chinese government. At the end of the day, I don't mind skins with covered-up designs, however I am extremely concerned that they are made not because of creative inspiration, but because of censorship pressure in China. I hope more people in the Genshin community who like conservative designs can realize that the regulation is not here to help them, although it indirectly give what they want. The CCP regulation not only impacts female character designs for now, but will also affect male character designs as those designs considered feminine or anything event slightly LGBTQ related will also face pressure of censorship.",

Almost certainly more than celebs, because most celebrities play multiple characters, but most characters only have one actor. Combine 1 and 2 (some mistyping due to the over representation of N types online and those are the ones who are doing the assigning) and then add that, you can see how you end up with more intuitive types. Sure, 3 is also possible\u2014 but it doesn\u2019t need to be if the other three reasons are all working against it.",

For example, INTx types surely dominate the science category (32.6%, with XXXX profiles making another 22.5%. Counting only profiles with a significant number of votes (50+) brings it up to 50%), despite making about 5.4% of real life population according to your data. And I wouldn't be surprised at all if there is massive overrepersentation of intuitives in the philosophy category. And probably in the arts as well. You talked about bias in created profile of fictional characters, but I believe you might be looking the wrong way. And then there's the polling category. With the site's users being overwhelmingly intuitive, I'd bet that more than 90% of the \"vote your type\" profiles are intuitive. Checking the \"vote your type if you like [...]\" subcategory, almost 95% of the profiles there are intuitive (if we're including the XXXX profiles which are all tied up between two intuitive types, it's more than 96%).",

The problem is that a county-based geography isn't uniform, so some of the super-large counties in the lower left throw off the visualization. In this view, the contribution of a per-capita rate in a large county with 100,000 residents shouldn't be nearly as important if it's right next to a tiny county with millions of residents with much higher hospitalization and death rates. Taking it holistically up to the state level might not be as visually intense, but considering that's the level where many COVID policies seem to be set rather than at county levels, it could be easier to visually process and you'd maybe see stuff like Texas and Florida stand out more.",

Those areas have the lowest per capita and death from Covid - and in Oregon the vaccination rate is much lower than the Bay Area California. Yet nobody is talking about how well places with longer duration mask rules faired from Covid death - even in this discussion. Instead fixating on only the vaccination rate. The scientific illiteracy is the reason news media isn\u2019t talking about this nationally, because Portland Oregon burned to the ground ( and it\u2019s still on fire ) we can\u2019t point to this state and say \u201cYep, masking works.\u201d",

One thing that's left out frequently in these types of posts is actually doing something proactively about the problem for the long run and not just here-and-now fixes. My #1 advice: Strengthen the whole muscle (musclefibers and tendons). Coincidentally that's also a proven way to fix RSI. Sincerely a newly grad. physiotherapist who loves gaming :)",

        "Comment": "I think a huge problem that nobody ever talks about is that a lot of people enjoy Path by playing super long hours at league start and then not much if any before the start of the next league. If you're planning on taking time off on friday or monday for 6+ (or 8, or 10+) hour sessions, you need to do regular training in the week(s) leading up to it! You wouldn't just go from being completely sedentary to running a marathon. To be able to resist localised pain you need to warm up your wrist/arm and train them, and to sustain proper posture for giga long sessions you need to train the rest of your body. If the muscles holding you up are not strong enough, which I can guarantee they aren't for 99% of Path enjoyers, you're going to fall into the goblin slouch over a long session (or just a couple of minutes, let's be real) and that's going to eventually cause you several kinds of pain.",

At least that is the case for me. Once you got into the habit its not so bad, you get so good at working out efficiently you will loose at most 1 hour a day. When i got into IT i was sitting in front of a computer pretty much 24/7 with 0 exercise, when i developed problems with my arms i found a simple trick to make it better, it might work for some others here... Turn your arm outwards so that your elbow is further outwards than your wrist. That together with a tilted hand (like holding a pencil) will relax your arm and remove the strain. you can go as far as 45\u00b0 close to your body to get the most out of it, sure it looks stupid and might take a little getting used to but thats a small price to pay. Ofc this way of using a mouse is a lot easier with a vertical mouse, but i found it unnecessary to get one as i was doing fine with a normal one. Then again, working out would be the better decision, i highly recommend it. It isn't just good for physical health but also mental health, it gives a lot of energy and is a natural anti-depressive. Which we will need after the 3.17 patch notes. :^)",

        "Comment": "I have \"RSI\", or rather carpel-tunnel syndrome, in both hands, primarily from computer use, and went to a sports doctor and physical therapist for a couple months. A couple notes: Disclaimer: everything bulleted is a paraphrase of what a single doctor told me, he seems to know his shit but who knows, so take with a grain of salt \"RSI\" is a broad umbrella term that doctors (mine anyway) don't really use. Its use is a bit confusing because it includes nerve issues (e.g. carpel tunnel) and tendon/ligament issues as well as some other issues which have very different causes/treatments Most people with RSI from gaming alone probably have nerve issues, tendonitis is also common in general but usually involves a high load event as the key cause (again, according to my doctor) The most common nerve issue diagnosis is carpel tunnel syndrome, which is aggravation of the median nerve in the carpel tunnel, but you can have nerves issues literally anywhere. I also had a lot of aggravation in my forearm (pronator syndrome) and a little in my elbow (tennis elbow). I have pretty bad posture and probably genetics too :-( Its definitely possible to get it in the left hand, esp if you play WASD FPS games. If you start doing a bunch of unergonomic stuff with one hand to minimize use of the other one, you'll probably wind up with issues in both arms like I did Nerve issues are caused by excess friction as the nerve rubs against its surroundings. Bad ergonomics and repetitive motion both have multiplicative effect on the amount of friction. Once the nerve becomes inflamed, friction increases even more, leading to a self-sustaining condition. I did PT for a couple months and it didn't help much for me personally.  I sill have the issues if I do anything repetitive and/or neglect my posture, WASD FPS games or most console gaming is a no-go. I can still play PoE but try to focus on 1-button builds and make heavy use of the numpad trick. Edit: spelling",

I bind both \u2018move only\u2019 and my main skill to the keyboard. This is by far the most impactful thing I do to avoid RSI. Moving around without clicking took some getting used to, but this is such a huge relief for my right arm that it was easily worth adapting for. Of course, clicking is still used for looting, but that\u2019s a manageable amount for me, especially now that currency drops in stacks. I\u2019ve had \u2018move only\u2019 and my main skill bound to the keyboard for years, but it was hard to propose others try this while players\u2019 lefts hands were busy enough playing flask pianos. Now, thanks to Instilling Orbs, I suspect more players might benefit from letting their left hands bear a greater load. Man, great idea. Can I put this on caps lock and automate that too?",

You often see people saying you should take break to do stretches, but honestly, you can just try doing them routinely when you have downtime IRL. Are you waiting for your pasta water to boil? Do some stretches. Are you waiting for an elevator? Do some stretches. Are you taking a dump? Do some stretches. If you just make them a habit while you are waiting, they basically take no time at all. That makes them extremely efficient and efficiency is what PoE is all about.",

After it -stretching. Then you can try vitamins, esp B group.  But rsi prone people usually have anatomical predispositions.  The main advice: never ever put any game before your health and if they are going to ban you for it -that's on them.",

When it got really bad I got a program, FadeTop, that every hour faded my right screen and popped up the message \"Break, you piece of shit\". It helps a ton, just a small break stretching my hands, wrists and go do something else. Staying healthy and sleeping well. It's a no brainer, but it helps a ton.

Generally speaking, I experience the most discomfort in my left and right fingers because I just don't find it comfortable to spam the mouse buttons all the fucking time. Really though, the most important tip you missed is to take a break. Seriously, taking a 5 minute break on the hour is the least you can do.

Desks with trays used to be common but for some reason they\u2019re hard to find nowadays. I don\u2019t know if trays are comfortable for everyone, but I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s a bad idea to have the keyboard and mouse higher than the level of your elbows when gaming/typing. 100% agree! I have an old desk with a tray and I was looking for a new desk to replace it and it's so weird to me that it is pretty much non-existent nowadays, I tried a desk without a tray and it's just terrible, thought it was just me.",

        "Comment": "Nagle's isn't just something that slows down connections. It's designed to transfer data with as little overhead as possible. TCP headers are the same size no matter what, so if you're constantly sending small packets then the majority of your line is being used to send non-payload data. The idea behind scheduling / throttling is to allow priority to certain tasks without choking out others. It's not just limiting for the sake of limiting. Setting a limit allows users to deal with issues when an application starts capping a CPU rather than becoming completely unresponsive. Microsoft makes a choice about what to present in menus in order to keep them simple and useful, but things aren't really hidden from you, they're given to you in the registry. If you took every OS setting that can be changed in the registry, and put it somewhere in Settings / Control panel, you would have a convoluted mess that would be borderline unusable anyway. Some of these settings are perhaps too conservative of defaults, based on what modern networks / computers can do, but saying It's crazy how much Microsoft gimps your PC from it's full gaming potential and the amount of stuff they hide from you. is a big overstatement.",

Again, the game is more responsive now though, I mean a lot more responsive. I had no idea I was being logged into the Xbox app right after the game starts up before I made those registry tweaks, I just saw a black screen sometimes. lol Now I see the xbox app signing me in on the game. :) Graphics are more responsive, yeaaaaa! That's probably why my inputs were off sometimes too. Microsoft you suck, wtf, why gimp our systems?",

Lol I mean shoe problem, I've been really obsessed with collecting Jimmy choo's nft womens shoes they are first edition they are dirt cheap and I can't figure out why? I mean other then the fact that it's in binance marketplace and it's not even a year old.. Or people just stay away from binance or.. people just don't care for these limited supply sparking shoes like I do! This might sound a bit morbid but Jimmy choo's luxury footwear is rated 3rd best in the world and this guy Jimmy is in his mid 60's all I can see is $$$ signs when this guy dies.... Don't stuff go up in value based on condition? These will be perfect for ever!! Also all the money for the shoes goes to charity, that's the real reason I keep buying ;) anyways guys what are your thoughts on this. Am I stupid and wasting my Money?",

This obsession with making everyone look so young is a little unsettling really but i guess eastern consumers are just in to that. Also really not a fan of the Mimi redesign, she was one of the nicest looking ones and now she looks all generic like Ayaka. Gorou is a walking nightmare, Sara and Baal are NPC villager tier. Yae Sakura looks very washed out. Really not a fan of the next wave of designs, I probably wont be pulling til the next region now, I cant even imagine how many fates ill have by then haha.",

But the reason i, as a developer, use search engines is to find forum posts on very specific Programming issues. I tried doing that with several SAP/ABAP related issues and unfortunately i couldnt really find anything helpful for my problems there. I know that your index is still growing, but thats literally the only reason i would use a search engine for. EDIT: I just tested the Maps feature and i absolutely love it, i have always been a fan of the OpenStreetMap API and its implemented really smooth and it just works. To be honest in the future ill probably use your version of Maps, instead of Googles' However i like the idea and the philosophy with which you guys approach your concepts. I would be happy to use your website if it could get more accurate on search results. Since its open-source ill probably take a look at the source and maybe give advanced feedback to that. Cheers and good luck on your project:)",

EDIT: I still really like the UI and finding common servers works really well, but if I want to search for a TYPE of website or a specific page on a website (like StackOverflow post) it doesn't work that well. Definitely needs some improvement, but as it's still in beta, I assume stuff like this will improve over time.",

        "Comment": "The first thing I did was change the language setting for preferred results (This could vary the experiences of your users and they may not know know about this setting) (I chose english for these tests) In the latest version of the Firefox browser app for Android OS, maps works well until I search for directions and and push 'Enter' to search but it just tabs/switches between the 2 Edit fields instead of processing my request (From and To) Some searches don't seem to be associated correctly. Searching \"Amazon pool toys\" gives me an Affiliated link to Amazon.com--good--an Ad link to Amazon.in (india i believe and not useful for my purposes) and the rest are links that are not owned by Amazon.com Inc. I will often search for \"%search% wiki\" (e.g. firefly wiki) This netted me nothing useful so i lengthened it to \"firefly wikipedia tv series\" I got the correct German page ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_\u2013_Der_Aufbruch_der_Serenity ) but not an english one I also sometimes make use of Google's conversion feature (\"5Mbps in KB/s\") For Videos, I like to know the domain the video from. In reference to \"Associated\" searches, I meant searching: \"Amazon [An Item or items]\" means Amazon .com, .de, .uk, etc. Regex: \"Wiki (.*)\" would result in wikipedia.org and wikia pages. Great work so far! A lot of it is working fairly well :) Perhaps some of the issues are not enough pages indexed? You all are the experts. Do as you wish with the info--I hope it helps! :) I will continue to use it and I'll make sure to let you know of any issues Edit: Sorry for the formatting and also I believe a lot of people use google as a catch-all. I search for 1 word to read the definition of it or get synonyms and the conversion feature i mentioned already. It's just real easy and convenient to push ctrl + T and quickly type in the incorrect spelling of a word and get the correct one. I think it is a goal and important to get to the point of becoming people's default search engine--even if it isn't as good or better than google but an alternative as you have said.",

The color scheme is very easy on my med student eyes, much 'softer' than glaring white. Also, I love that you've worked around your limitations by providing 'exit' links to other search engines! That way, when I'm making obscure searches that Findx may not be able to unearth, I don't have to worry about not getting the full scope of available info. Don't think I've ever seen a search engine do that. I really like the design and I know you guys are in beta but I will definitely consider switching over to Findx in the near future. I hope you guys never fall prey to rampant advertising (it's understandable, but there are limits) and censorship. I know that some topics are taboo in Europe and I really hope I can depend on Findx in the future to tell me what's REALLY going on in the world. -Brandy",

FindX worked great for the first two results, however the third is the reason I won't be using it right this second. It gave links to the MSDN homepage, which is not at all what I was looking for (the Unity 5 C# API documentation). I do acknowledge that this is probably due to your spider having not reached that page yet, however Unity 5 is probably the biggest game-oriented software development kit in the world right now. For developers such as myself, being able to find snippets of the manual is necessary (as you probably know, as a fellow developer :D). As far as planning trips without ads, I love it! If I'm about to make a turn on a highway, my navigator wont have to sit through \"Axe hairspray - it's the right choice.\" Which is great! I have to say, I really love what you guys are doing. It is more important than ever to have a transparent search engine which won't sell your data, so please post again whenever you guys have more sites added to your database. I'll definitely be watching! Edit: I'm also learning Japanese, and it seems your site cannot differentiate between a Japanese word and a single Japanese character. I tested this with \u308f\u3089\u3046 (warau, laugh/smile) and expected to be given EUDict or something for its respective kanji word, \u7b11\u3046. Instead, it searched for only \u308f (the top results were for the Hiragana character for wa). This is not good for Japanese learners/natives yet, which is a fairly small but also important demographic.",

        "Comment": "First and foremost the crowdsourcing aspect with having users rate results in my opinion is the best way to go. In the world of the internet a crowdsource works the best. As it is still in beta I understand it will not work perfectly but there were a few troubling aspects. General searches for well know non-specific things work tremendously. Searching well known historical events brings usually the Wikipedia page which works the best. Less specific things will get left behind especially in a crowd source and that can be a problem. Those results will be rated less often and will be forgotten, and in many cases the first result for those non-specific things will not be the best result or even a relevant one at all. I think this is where another part of crowdsourcing could work by having people with an ability to either explain why a certain result shouldn't be at the top or included, and a way to bring the best results up higher, instead of just ways to describe the content inside. Also the \"search this page\" function is nice but is near inaccessible on mobile. Anyways what you have done is amazing and I hope for the best going on as I will continue to use this search engine.",

        "Comment": "So I did some searching around on the search engine and it seemed decent but here are some things that I thought could be changed/added to make it better. Implement a calculator and unit conversion when you search for something of the sort. For example if you search 2+2 it should show you it is four or if you search Celsius to Kelvin it should have a conversion module. It is too similar to Google in my opinion. Simply waving privacy in peoples face isn't going cause a significant amount of people to switch long term it needs something that sets it apart yet doesn't make it hard or annoying to use. Maybe an additional feature that google and the like don't have, or a different format than others. when you search for something sometimes it doesn't even come close to what you wanted and even searching for a few pages doesn't help so it would be nice to have a secondary search bar (or something of the sort) so you can find a result and upvote it for that search. Also if you do not have any WiFi and you search something it has a message that tells you you have no internet but even when the internet return you still cannot search you need to close the page and reopen it to search again. That's what I found at least I am not a professional by any means in this field so somethings I said might not be doable or but these were ways I found that might improve the search engine. Keep up the good work!",

        "Comment": "First post, and i doubt it will even be read. I'm seeing a lot of similarities in the comments. Lots of developers or those learning coding(myself) complaining that they can't find programming results fast enough. When I'm attempting to code, I easily can have 12 tabs of Google open at once and I'm sifting through them. Since I like where you're going, I want to help out. My suggestions: A. Change the rate option to just a thumb up/thumb down B. Remove thumb down search results C. Change color scheme/theme And to expound on my suggestions: A. Noone in a hurry is going to rate in the way you've set it up. There's no incentive to and it takes too long. B. Removing each search result that the user thumbs down will not only improve future results, but will also aid the user in navigating the site faster. I can hover my mouse in a single spot and the page will scroll for me AS I'm improving your search engine AND finding my results in a hurry. C. This one is minor, so feel free to skip it. While I like the clean look of the site(I'm trying purely on mobile), and I'm going to be blunt, it looks like a Google knockoff. If I'm at your site, I don't want Google for whichever reason. Make it clear with the color scheme that I'm not at Google. The minimalist search bar and all white background kind of screams Google. Maybe a light or dark grey akin to the dark color schemes of eclipse or visual studio. If I'm using a search engine, I expect to stay there for a max of 40 seconds, but would be happier to be gone in 15. I, like the rest of us, have been spoiled by Google. Sucks that everyone is comparing to Google, but Google is to search engines as WoW is to MMOs.",

I feel like your engine is very strict about that. I like if there's a sidebar or the top results are Wikipedia articles. Also I really hope you improve your image search. In it's current form it is almost useless Great job so far, curious about what's the final product will be!",

In gaming, I searched for 'mythic botanist', looking for strategy and kill videos for a World of Warcraft boss. Findx gave me a few guilds pages just stating they had killed it, with non-english results on the first 2 pages. Google gave me strats, videos, discussions on how to progress with it and world first kill info. In politics, I searched 'running for alabama governor'. First page results talking about the UK, major league baseball and the top 3 'results' being advertisements for Nordstrom. The top real result is a 10 year old illuminati conspiracy site that looks like it was written by a madman and froze my browser with the insane length. The top infobox on google gives me dates of elections, the wiki of the electoral process and articles relevant from the past weeks of who is running. In technology, I searched 'wannacry'. Nothing even close to discussion on the hottest tech topic right now with the WannaCry malware attack, just mariah carey and kieth urban music on..chinese karaoke mp3s? lol I dont know. Google well aware of the malware attack.",

I find that really useful with google but its not a deal breaker. Another thing I noticed was the way the results came in to see it in blocks (I am using my 23 inch monitor) I initially thought they were all ads (google conditioned me to see blocks in search results that way). Again, not a deal breaker just my thoughts from the first use. The results that came through were perfect though. I got what I was looking for on the first result and the rest of the results that came back seemed relevant. I tried to use the maps to plan a trip but typing the city and state in it autogenerated where what I was looking for, I clicked on the city and when I tried to see the route it said it cannot find the destination. The site is clean and quick and I enjoyed using it. I will try and use it at work today and edit if I notice anything else. Goodluck!",

I watch anime on a page called \"PunchSubs\", If I search on google, I get their facebook page on first result, from there I get their address, by just putting \"punchsubs\". On your search engine its not even on main page, some results include porn sites that the keyword doesn't even is the same ex: \"Search Result: punching at Sex Gay Tube\". (thats kind of annoying, specially if kinds want to see anime being caught with a few porn results that don't fully relate to the search) Another example, if I want to access the Portuguese website \"abola.pt\", they from time to time change domain. I usualy type: \"abola\", and their website is the first to appear on google, on findx it appears only as 5th result. I am sure I can put more examples, but I am continuing to test, but in sum its a great work. Will test it deeply with some programming questions I usualy have and then see how quickly it shows an entry with an answer comparing to google.",

I'm nowhere to be found for some of them, but absolute garbage websites rank high. It also shows that my site is http:// when I switched to https:// a few weeks ago. It redirects, so it's not a big deal, but just something I noticed. Also, when I do find my site, it sometimes links to a page that is less relevant to the search than another page on my site would be. For example, I searched for \"Beautyrest Comparison,\" and it took me to my categories page of blog posts, showing all articles about mattress comparison. ( https://www.mattressnerd.com/category/comparison-shopping/ ) It would've made A LOT more sense to point to one of my 3 blog posts SPECIFICALLY dedicated to Beautyrest, or my Comparison Shopping Service page which has a Beautyrest chart, and is much more prominent on my website. Here are some specific examples of nonsense: I searched for \"what is a box spring.\" Without quotes, there isn't a single article about mattresses on the front page. The highest ranking site is about Disney. With quotes, it only finds 10 articles, and none of them are about boxsprings, though most are at least about mattresses. My site doesn't show up. On Google, my boxspring article is in the 3rd position on average according to Google Webmaster Tools. I searched for Tempurpedic Alternatives, which Google ranks me number 1 for on average, and my article isn't on there. On the second page, it links to my homepage (rather than my article with the title of the search), and above me are foreign cooking websites and the like. There's one about \"sauces your pantry can't do without\" and one about coffee.",

        "Comment": "Hi Brian, The load time took a while, around 5 seconds. I'm in the EU with a good fiber optic connection. However, a couple of visits later it's responding quickly. Why the animation of the results? Do they serve a purpose of something happening while loading in the results? If not, I'd say get rid of them. They might be fancy to look at but they will not be something regular searchers will enjoy in the long run. As a user I expect search engines today to understand my question asked to it, e.g. \"Weather in Boca Raton, Florida?\" or \"Weekend weather in Boca Raton, Florida?\". As a user I want my search engine to bring me relevant results, but also ads that are relevant, if you must... Showing me a Dutch ad when I search in English and have an IP that isn't Dutch, suggests that you might need to tweak it a little. As a user I expect to find New York if I search it first using the search engine, then go over to Maps. Where are you New York? I'm really struggling with all the animations, the side menu, the \"Webmaster Tools\". I'd like to hear the reason for these animations and if they serve a purpose. I realize that some animations might be helpful to users to understand layers and functionality. But the animations I'm talking about seem to serve no purpose other than aesthetics, in which case, I believe they hurt more than they provide in terms of the user experience over time. I like that I can delimit the results using - but when I add +SOMETHING it doesn't turn up a result, not sure why? I'd also like to be able to use operators but I guess that's more towards the future. But using filetype:, inurl: and intitle: can be really powerful when searching. Overall I didn't find the current version of your search engine impressive, the results weren't as accurate as I'd like them to be. I'll get some relevant results at first only to get a totally irrelevant result. To prove my point; search 'soundcloud', I got a link to google analytics in the top #4. However, I will keep an eye out and make sure to see if you made any improvements to it with time. Good luck with the project!",

I really like the ad-placement, they don't disrupt the search and I don't mind them at all. My adblock definitely stays off on your website :) The search is often not picking up relevant results though and I've had trouble finding some basic stuff (for example I searched for 'java array' and only found a lot of results that were not relevant at all) but it works fine for the most part. I couldn't get the map-search to work at all. It failed to find 'Berlin' and only showed me 'Sorry, we can't find berlin' as an answer to my query. So I can't really comment on that but from the looks of it (only having seen the map itself with no searches) I really look forward to trying it as soon as it works for me. All in all I very much hope that your search-engine improves to the point where I can use it for most searches but as of now it's really lacking in the whole 'finding relevant result' sector (which is perfectly understandable for a new search engine but still a dealbreaker).",

Acording to findx's maps I do not have javascript enabled while I do, weirdly other websites, which require javascript, work correctly. It doesn't seem to have darkmode. Ads seem to be too frequent. (maybe I just tried searching for things which are easily advertised) On freshly installed chromium (and highly modified Firefox) maps say \"Sorry, we can't find London\" (or any other location). Results seem to be weird, when I search for \"google\" I expect to find \"google.com\" not \"google.com/xyz\". Also is there any functional difference between those two links: \" http://www.youtube.com \" and \" https://www.youtube.com/ \"? Those are first two results for \"youtube\". Other than that results seems to be reasonable.",

        "Comment": "As a guy who does SEO a lot, I am super interested to see how people approach this kind of stuff. I did a few searches to see what comes up. I am mostly interested in local search results like \"X in town Y\"  or brand names of small businesses, etc. I did notice that brand name searches came up flat. for example, a search for \"clear counsel\" or \"clear counsel las vegas\" does not bring up the company clearcounsel.com or their domain on the front page, despite an exact match in url and title tag. When I searched for the domain itself, the blog page came up two notches higher than the main page.  I checked several other local businesses and got similar results, sometimes a search for the exact domain wouldn't even bring up the site. It seems that 301 redirects do not pass along search \"authority\" (or juice or whatever the appropriate term for findx is) in the way that the big G does, which means some sites with TONS of links created this way are not showing up at all in findx. In one case I saw the 301 redirected domain as a higher result than the domain to which it was redirected. I assume this is simply due to the crawler not having been back around since indexing it, or is it intentionally showing the redirected domains? I'd be interested in having some search functions like \"site: \" so I could see how many pages are indexed, and hopefully when they were indexed. What would be SUPER interesting to me as an SEO would be to see 301 redirected domains and pages pop up in the search for the domain to which they were redirected.  This would be a hugely valuable research tool for people in my industry, since we could then check not only the backlinks pointed directly at the domain, but the links pointed at the \"supporting\" domains as well.",

I guess what I'm trying to say is, all 3 of my searches were basically saying the same thing, just worded differently each time.

While searching a bunch of things, here are some issues I've found: The map search doesn't work with USA zip codes.  90210 (beverly hills) sends me to South America. Searching for a subreddit like r/newyorkfood is tough.  On Findx, when I search \"Reddit New York Food,\" the result isn't listed, although it's the first result on Google with the same search. If you enter the name of the city on the Web tab, it'd be nice if a preview came up via the map tab, to make it more prominent to click on. While simply searching for a location, it would nice to have the Wikipedia article as a prominent result to learn about the place. If I want to look for the restaurant Sweet Green in Manhattan, searching \"Sweet Green Manhattan\" brings up no relevant results Feedback-wise, it would be nice to have a feedback button next to the search bar, so that when I search something and no relevant results show up, I can click it and say why I couldn't find what I was looking for. Thanks for making a great alternative - looking forward to seeing how it moves forward!",

When I search for key words in current news articles, I'm not getting the most recent results. \"North Korea\" for instance, did a great job of getting me their official site and the Wikipedia entry, but I would have expected to see at least some mention of their recent missile launch. Some of the key terms produced articles from 2015-2016. I'm also concerned about how you plan to manage the mob mentality and echo chamber effect that will inevitably effect the rating system. It feels like Facebook, tbh, and I don't want to rely on the mob's definition of what a good resource is.",

This is also the name of my website, and was recently on Kickstarter. 4 links came up. All were relevant (it's a roleplaying game, and they were all roleplaying forums), but none were particularly helpful, they were places that had mentioned us, rather than the website or Kickstarter (primary sources) or even the Q&As we'd held on Reddit or other sites. It was offhand mentions in forums, which seems like an odd source.",

First of all it's a highly interesting project especially if you consider lots of criticism against user tracking and data mining etc. The first thing I tried was adding my website to the index, you know - to support the project (and mine hehe). It was as easy as you could imagine: Step 1: Enter the website url Step 2: ... Ye that was it. I expect it to be fully added within a few hours? I understand the security procedure of the bots obviously. But so far: Very easy! I then tried the actual search engine. I goog- haha oops. I searched for my university. Firstly, yes it has been added. What was striking for me is this little feedbar bar so you can report whether or not this website was implemented appropriately. I like this. After a few searches I found everything I needed. What I actually prefer on findx over google is the sleek design. I like the animations and simple white-greyish-blue. Concluding I guess this site is really not bad and definitely has potential. I do have to say though, that firstly I don't really mind data mining etc. because I feel like it has a good effect on myself as a regular user. Secondly, I sort of depend on google services like YT, Gmail etc. I might just stick with Google. Nonetheless I will definitely keep an eye on findx. I like it I hope this was good feedback :)",

So have been using it for some half hour now, doing product research, image and video search, and also checking out some locations, here are my impressions: Somehow it felt that I got what I was looking for pretty fast, but maybe it's just the exictement of testing things, the results for specific items are well organized. The maps feature works really fast IMHO, but lacks detail, my home town looks good and all streets are there, but where I currently live there's no street names, I guess I currently live in phantomville. I felt the image search feature was paaaainfully slow when loading the thumbnails. Maybe it's still in development or you are using some static source while it's in beta, but it is really slow. The video search was faster than the image search, bringing results and also loading the thumbnails, points for the anonymity warning when trying to play a video.",

Other searches seemed to have similar results ('Lindbergh blvd' brought up an aged beer review site's page for a now defunct bar, again results dated 4+ years ago.) . Also the lack of location data was telling, searching for \"Kinloch\" brought up SEO heavy pages for a resort half a world a away, instead of the municipal website for a community 2kM from me.

I do have a few suggestions, mostly based around UX: I do like the way the search bar collapses when switching to the map tab, but I wish there were a setting to make it expand on hover, rather than clicking the expand button every time. This one is very minor, but the dropdown menus in the options will only close when selecting an option or clicking out of the dropdown. It would be nice if you could click on the original menu dropdown to close it again. There are several other things I really enjoy in particular, one of them being the quality rating system- this seems like a great way to get a general consensus of what content is the most relevant to the search. I definitely look forward to using the site more and more as it grows and improves!",

Google gave me some possibly relevant pictures for the Peter Capaldi search, Google clearly gave me the answer to my 10th president query there directly on the page, whereas findX didn't even have what I was looking for on any of the first several results. Maybe findX is better for academic type researching, I don't know, I didn't try it. But Google inarguably has a much better user interface, and I got the answer to my president question without having to say \"of the USA\". So my question is, why should I use findX if Google is easier to use?",

I know it is early in developement but those results are just completely unrelated. A few positive things tough are that it's really quick and works flawlessly, the UI looks really clean and it works really well on mobile. I don't want to say too many bad things about it since it is in early developement but it could certainly be improved, the problem is that it's a search engine that doesn't search well, wich is a big problem, everything else tough looks great and it's also really fast, you just need to do some serious work on your actual search function and you could rival Google for me",

One of the things I google the most is official records on companies, when we take them on as new customers, to see how they operate/who is affiliated. When I type the words Companies House followed by the company name what usually happens is the first result up the top of the search results is the direct link to that company's listing at Companies House. Doing this in your search engine, the results are related to the company name, but it has completely 100% ignored the words Companies House. Looking through several pages of results, I still haven't found a single one. Hope that is something that can be fixed as I like the look of findx.",

It's fast, clean, and the directions are thorough. I'm sure you guys will keep building from here and make t even better. Best of luck!",

Say what?\" I love it also you notice how tunnelbear VPN has a lot of bear puns and all that, keep up the good work I find it fine that your main priority is web search but remember your a privacy company so dont forget to work on the privacy aspect, I find the maps thing okay I guess but I would not really mind if it was not there lets be honest using an adblocker on google would be the same for the ads the new design is pretty good but I doubt anybody would really use it too much not trying to bring you guys down, its good but dont spend to much time on it, also I recommend changing the logo way to bland and boring maybe find an animal just like duckduck go and tunnel bear maybe a Possum? lol also try to go for a minimalist design thats it thanks.",

Even if they didn't work directly with covid they see the effects of hospital corporations trying to squeeze every last dollar out of an already tight staff. I wish the medical community as a whole could speak out and really articulate what it's been like the past year and how working for a business that claims to be a provider of compassionate care is really just for profit. Part of me feels like people won't listen anyway. Something needs to change or we'll have more and more amazing hcps leaving medicine. Thank you for your words. Your work doesn't go unnoticed.

I\u2019ve felt shame and anger at my inability to articulate my experience, and my inability to convey the loss and fear and fury that was Covid at the bedside.  I\u2019ve lost faith in institutions and felt deep anger towards loved ones who can\u2019t, or won\u2019t, understand how it really was. But why should they? Yes some are ignorant but most love me, respect nurses, want to lift us up and protect us. Then I felt more shame for branding all support as performative when most was heart felt.  But now I have a new source of shame, and that is the apathy I feel when I clock in to work every day. I don\u2019t know how to navigate it and I\u2019ve felt alone for a great deal of this, even though I\u2019m surrounded by love. The point of this is to say thank you, whoever you are, for articulating what I\u2019ve never been able to put into words. And for making me feel a little less alone in what was before, and what is now. I\u2019m saving this post forever and holding it in my heart.",

To say I learned quick would be an understatement and I experienced, felt and thought everything you wrote. I keep thinking maybe I'm not a good fit for nursing but the more I reflect the more I realize I came into the system when all it's flaws were completely open and exposed. I'm currently in a place of turmoil, crying frequently, depressed and unmotivated to work or care. The strange duality of watching the world return to a degree of \"normal\" whilst still losing patients to covid is unnerving. I'm not sure how to move past this last year and a half. Baptized in fire. I never expected to be in a place where I needed the bipap turned as high as it could go because we only had one vent left in the hospital. I wasn't prepared to be the last person many patients saw. I wasn't ready to triage patients and hope they lived through the night with what we had which wasn't enough like many locations. My face is permanently scarred by the 4 month old N95, but my soul is scarred far worse.",

This pandemic unleashed a calling inside me that i had never experienced before as a nurse. A calling so loud that it deafened my emotions and awoke my sensitivity for impending doom. It muffled the human suffering in which we were fully immersed. So what happens when we try and resurface to a world that is reluctant to acknowledge the truth? Your title OP says it all, it is the death of the compassionate nurse. Is this the price we are expected to pay in order to return to civilization? Why is it that being compassionate leads us victum to losing our compassion entirely? Hasn't humanity already lost enough this last year? Yes we are nurses, but we are also morals, NOT heros. We are just regular people putting our lives and the lives of our families on hold in hope that we can save your mother, sister, brother, father or child from this suffocating death. We respect you (anti maskers and anti vaxers) enough to risk our lives to save yours, so please respect our health and safety so we can still be here to treat your loved ones.",

I had to take solace in knowing the changes I was expediting to the EHR would help people like you work faster, smarter, and safer. But it wasn't enough. It isn't the same and it doesn't absolve the pain that you endured for humankind. The non-healthcare people tell you that you are a hero, without ever having lived a fraction of what you've experienced. Just imagine how much of a hero you are to those of us who actually know what you've been through and couldn't do it with you. No matter what, I feel guilty that I couldn't carry the burden with you. So, from the bottom of my heart: thank you for being the hands and, most importantly, the heart of nurses like me who couldn't be by your side. \u2665\ufe0f",

The amount of covid cases are decreasing in my facility but patients keep coming in to the ED and it is non-stop. When I left for today, our ED census alone was 125. We are already prepping for another potential surge in July which may potentially  occur with so many people choosing to go out in public without masking. I hope you rediscover your passion.  But I must say, based on your style of writing, I sense your compassion and empathy is still deeply rooted within and that you are a fighter\u2026maybe you can repurpose your passion into something other than bedside nursing to create something more? Take care! Hope you will keep us posted on your next steps",

I feel so saddened by what you and all of the medical professionals out there trying to save lives just to be pushed down a hill of despair by the ignorant, prideful, and intitled humans we all try to help. You are appreciated beyond words I can express. I'm just a CNA(14yrs) and most patients don't even know what that is. I've been through codes, witnessed death happen in my presence and put deceased in body bags to transport to the morgue. I have so much respect for the RN's I have worked alongside. PTSD isn't just for veterans of war, but for all who have gone through hell and back and have witnessed horror beyond imagination. Don't give up. It's a hard job to care in a thankless world. It always helps to take time away and regroup from burnout. Don't let the horrific times deny you of positive moments. You did the best you could and we never can truly predict what outcomes are going to be. Many blessings to you and all you do. Keep your head held high for no one can understand another until they walk a mile in their shoes. I hope for all the best for you. A big internet hug for you \ud83e\udd17",

Going to war and fighting for a country that didn\u2019t truly believe in their cause and spit on them when they returned. While some could argue nurses don\u2019t go to war, they probably have never stepped foot in an ICU or covid unit during the last year. What I went thru as a nurse in WI on a medsurg floor is peanuts compared to you in an ICU in NY and I still relate to your piece and feel every line. Please take care of yourself.",

It's hard to believe that it'll be a year now since the pandemic really hit Phoenix. I still have PTSD from working on the COVID ICU units. I've only been a nurse for 6 years now but I have never seen anything like working in the COVID ICUs. EMS were bringing in pts who were dusky and satting in the 70s but struggling to breathe, vented pts were maxed on pressors and barely hanging on with sats in the 80s, as soon as you bagged one deceased pt, another one would take their place in an hour. May we never go through something like that again. I hope you once again find that compassion that got you into nursing in the first place. Much love from Phoenix!",

        "Comment": "ER has the worst burnout rate of all areas and you summed up why very well, and I appreciate you taking the time to share your feelings so the rest of us can be reminded we\u2019re not alone.  It feels like it\u2019s taboo to talk about it to your coworkers, and admittedly it is very draining when someone you work with declares that they\u2019re done and can\u2019t handle it anymore.  I\u2019m ok right now, because I came back to ER at the peak in my area right after getting my first shot, and cases sharply declined after that.  Either way it\u2019s still the ER, and I\u2019ve come to realize I can handle it for a few years at a time and then I need to take a break and work somewhere else for a bit. One thing that has helped me to handle the day to day stresses of being an ER nurse is to renew my focus on the patient interaction and completely divorce myself from the corporate relationship.  Yes, on paper I am an employee.  But to me, they\u2019re a place that is paying me to provide a service, and how I provide that service is up to me.  When you step back you realize that a lot of the shit that they dangle to boost morale or make you feel more invested is for their benefit, not yours.  I do they education i need to keep my job, and I keep updated licenses and certifications.  That\u2019s it.  I try to spend every minute I can with my patients, not hanging out at the desk making friends or chatting with my boss.  Maybe my coworkers don\u2019t buddy up to me much, maybe my boss hates me because I don\u2019t rearrange my personal life to show up because they failed to pay nurses what they\u2019re worth and now they have a staffing crisis. While I\u2019m there, I\u2019m there for the patients.  That includes the obnoxious needy ones, because most of the time they have something they\u2019re afraid of or have lost trust of healthcare and what you\u2019re seeing is just an annoying coping mechanism.  I think my experience in pediatrics really changed how I view my interactions with adults.  People say \u201cdon\u2019t make the mistake of thinking peds are just little adults,\u201d and that\u2019s true if not an over simplification.  The truth is \u201cdon\u2019t make the mistake of thinking an adult is anything but a big kid shaped by every bad thing that has ever happened to them.\u201d",

        "Comment": "You can be there again, maybe you need to move to a different floor or different hospital. Honestly the best way for nurses to protect themselves and their patients is if they persistently backed out of bad working environments and only worked for good hospitals or at least units with a good culture. Absolutely ridiculous that we have managerial units that lack understanding and a connection with their nursing staff but try and use them to benefit themselves and their 'accomplishments'. Nurses need to come together to be stronger. Unions are unions but whoevers running them also has their basic needs met and may lose their passion for who they're fighting for. New unions aren't necessary, new ways to learn to strike maybe aren't as needed either. But if the 'compassionate nurses', the ones who aren't just there just for a paycheque or to unload their own emotional garbage onto other people, they need to band up more and help coordinate what hospitals, what units are worth working for. This is the power structure some greedy employers want, workers who've put years into training and will accept an environment that can be stressful but that won't attempt to improve. Workers who they can 'use up' for a bunch of years and then if they burn out, get some new ones in. We need to recognize the employers/hospitals who do fix problems they encounter and appreciate them, and help those power structures grow. The more we continue applying to workplaces known to disregard their workers, disregard patient abuse towards staff, disregard managerial abuse of staff, the more we normalize them, the more we 'make it okay', and the worse it'll be for patients/nurses in the long run. Health care workers shouldn't be coming into work overwhelmed, burnt out, but that's just the norm nowadays and we're likely the only ones that can change it. Good hospitals need to be supported, heck even if more people apply to 'good' hospitals and theres a minor wage dip, in the long run its worth it to know you're cared about and that the integrity of the hospital is in line with your values. The more the 'good' culture hospitals grow the better chance that what we see happens in the hospital will improve. This isnt something we can do right away but something worth moving towards. The unity within nursing is important, and not just to argue for higher wages, but to decipher which hospitals are more in line with our values. There's a lot of trickle down effect from the top down, if the top people have high values, good experience, good morals, that trickles down to managers & everyone else. If the top guys don't give a beep, then managers have the same standard and they don't get any rewards for going past it. If the manager that treats everyone like shit can't hire anyone because word got out that the unit sucks... that hospital/unit may have financial troubles and those patients will be relayed to hospitals that do have workers. It's an evolution, survival of the fittest, and we're the ones allowing unfit hospitals to use unhealthy bullish tactics to benefit off our compassion. No guilt needed here, it's absolutely right to make a living, they're the ones being shady, but moving forward I think this is somewhere to find some strength in if nurses came together and started recognizing and investing their energies into better hospitals (these hospitals aren't always obvious but doing some research on the workplace cultures and the people running the hospital can be beneficial, if nurses had some private forum to discuss workplaces it may also be beneficial, something to basically share the info)",

        "Comment": "I left direct patient care a few years ago and now work at a health tech company. It blows my mind how poorly nursing staff is treated by everyone from hospital admins to patients and their family members. I lived in NYC in Spring 2020 and even found the cheering from the windows to ring hollow. Wealthy New Yorkers working from home don\u2019t REALLY understand what healthcare workers were living through during the pandemic. Let alone the service workers that routinely risked exposure to support them (delivery guys, etc.) I have never been happier to be away from bedside. It made me cynical and gravely disappointed in everyone. I know several people in direct clinical roles who have moved away from healthcare entirely and are quite happy. A loved one is a former physician and doesn\u2019t regret leaving medicine for a minute. If anyone reading this would like to hear more about how we did it please send me a message, happy to share details. It\u2019s not your fault that the healthcare system in the US has failed everyone and you are not giving up by saving yourself.",

Tate & Yoko sent me a credit and I've been eyeing the Crimson Sky in Women's Max, and Nightshade in Max. The two pairs I already have measure 15.75\" at the waist. Do y'all recommend purchasing a full size up? Thanks in advance.",

They removed the best missions coop strike and now most of the missions include gamemode that none likes to play. Competitive, guardian and wargames are good imo but casual, deathmatch, wingman and demolition range from mediocre to terrible. There is easy fix to improve gamemodes. Casual: limit max players to 12 and round timer to 2min. Wingman: change round timer to 1min and add maps where planting is more common since afterplant is most interesting part of round. Deathmatch: limit spawn protection to 3 sec, improve spawn locations, add ammo to mag after kill (5 bullets to rifles, machineguns and smg, 1 bullet to snipers shotguns and deagle/revolver, 3 bullets to rest of pistols), limit awp and autosnipers to 1-2 per team. Shortmatch (adjust economy and make it mr10) and gungame (add all guns and better maps) could also be improved but casual, wingman and deathmatch should be fixed 1st.",

Raking all these money and they can't even put in charge 2 people that would design the operation with love? Shit they release it once in two years, they could just put 1 person and if person's capable he'd do it in 1/4 of this time. I mean it is not expensive to buy the pass, but there has alwas been something exciting in the wait for the new operation, now this excitement just slides lower and lower :/",

I've been trying to piece together the puzzle after watching  youtube videos that seems to describe completely different movies both calling themselves \"Snuff R73\". My main remaining question is who is this \"Clinton Teale\" person? I can't seem to find any definitive information online. Closest I got is that that French blog named him as the creator of R73, but I gotta be honest that blog does not sound like a reputable source at all. From your post it sounds like Clinton Teale is a made-up character created for the ARG. Is that correct? Or is it (also) a real person?",

        "Comment": "Thanks for this.  I've watched and enjoyed B+B's videos, but always felt there was something \"off\" about him, not just in his behaviour and language towards women, but also a few opinions, comments, even little looks to the camera here and there made me wonder if there was something more unpleasant going on under the \"diamond geezer\" exterior. I found this group hoping to find some answers, but, like many others, have been disappointed to find it mostly consisting of wild, unsupported accusations and faux outrage.  Any attempt to question the validity of the claims are met with, \"check out the other pages\", which means wading through pages of links, most of which lead to interminably tedious 10 year-old forum flame wars which are somehow supposed to \"prove\" B+B is an evil sex pest.  Add to that the blatant misogyny certain members of this group show, the toleration of which displays an embarrassing degree of hypocrisy, and the frankly unhinged speculations and fantasies of the other moderator (seriously, you can make a drinking game out of the amount of times he uses the word 'probably' before inventing yet more claims about B+B direct from his own imagination, which reveal much more about what's going on in his own head than anything else), and all in all this group comes across as a pathetic bunch of jealous gossips, so short of anything concrete to whinge about that you have to make something up. But this post nails it.  The claims are clear, evidence is given.  This is how it should be done.  To be honest, the best thing you could do would be to delete all the other threads in this group, and just keep this one up, as a clear source of truth.  If any further concrete evidence arose, another post could be created.  I mean, I know that won't happen because certain people seem to get off on fantasising about all the things Bald's 'probably' been getting up to, but it would make your case a lot more persuasive.",

To be honest I've thought about it sometimes, when I saw \"Harald Baldr\" featured in his vids. Because that guy straight-out looks like a creep and talks like a creep. He looks like the definition of a guy trafficking girls. I don't find Mr. Bald, to have a creepy appeal, but he do seem quite sociopath at times, the way he just doesn't give a fuck, is unnatural and wierd. I have unsubbed. Morally speaking I think there's a bit too much nasty stuff. I can go far enough to understand why some people mess up in their twenties, and end up hurting one woman, not that I have ever hurt a woman like that, but I have met other guys who have, mainly due to alcohol and they have felt terrible bad over it.",

I definitely got similar vibes from his friends too. It\u2019s not particularly damning, but he had a video up for a few weeks detailing his recovery from coronavirus, where he spent a while discussing how his \u201cpenis had shrunk\u201d. He also said a friend got him into a Serbian hospital, into a nice room. I don\u2019t think his connections are limited to PUA forums but perhaps dodgier non-internet based groups of people. Who knows, but it seems fairly clear cut to me that he\u2019s dodgy, whether he\u2019s exaggerating these scenarios or not.",

        "Comment": "Yeah I think it's him. He mentions his bike a \"Royal Enfield\" in one of his posts:  \" Go to India,it's a mad experience. The contrasts are amazing,check out  Ladakh or the North East,wild and stunning places which you will love  but don't go expecting to bang regular Indian girls. What you can do is  bang hundreds of horny backpackers.  (....) I had great times riding my Royal Enfield along the route with a different girl on the back each week,awesome memories.\" On his youtube channel you can find a video riding that Royal Enfield in India: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnzGl_0aBik He also mentions his age in one of his posts in 2012, which matches with his birthday. And uses phrases like \"bloody hell\" which are common even in his current videos. I see that guy now in a total different way. It's not about exploring the world and how beautiful it is that you can find even in the most rural places some human kindness. That's just a fairy tale that he tells. The truth is that he hunts for hopeless poor influenceable young ladys all over the globe to use them for his sexual habits. He goes to extreme places to have a free field for his hunting. Where nobody can protect the ladys. He goes constantly into dysfunctional social systems in Russia or East-Europe. Never in more stable regions like Germany or France. I understand now why. And his current girlfriend is by far way too young for him. Tell me what you want he is over 50. You don't deal with such a young lady in that age. Yes she is 29 and an adult. But the difference is significant. She could be his daughter. You can see in his posts that he has a hard time to stay with one woman. He is in constant search for something else. This is why he is jumping around the globe all the time like a maniac. He risks many times too much. Even after he had covid he hopped right away to the next country. He will be in big trouble some day. I don't think we have enough to stop him. He has to break the law to get any stop signs.",

I started off being incredibly curious about Ben and Harald/Jen's background because... how can you just live like this?  Going from country to country seemingly without a care in the world, perhaps surviving on YouTube and Patreon money. But finding out all this stuff is unsettling to say the least. I find myself thinking about people like Michael Jackson.  I really like Mr Bald's videos and adventures and his persona.  I like the subjects - like we all probably do.  His past doesn't change my enjoyment of his content, but it does ignite more of a wonder about the things he hides.  People enjoy Michael Jacksons music despite the things he was accused of, and the same could be said about other people in the limelight. If what OP mentioned is all accurate (and hats off, cause it seems pretty airtight) then of course a lot of it is sick, it's twisted.  For a moment I wondered if the things claimed online under these aliases were just bigging himself up to other sick people, but I don't know. Now that he's fairly famous in the YouTube world and may well have had tens or even hundreds of victims (is this the right word?) - I really wouldn't be surprised if one day it all came crashing down when one of the poor people affects speaks up, recognises him and identifies him.  One falling out with someone who knows him well and it can all come out on a larger platform too.",

        "Comment": "Just two things to say The writeup is very good, but it's unreliable. I went down this rabbit hole last year and believe most of what you say but you provide only patchy sources. Having read lots of his forum posts, I believe your account of his past and what he has said (i.e. visits to Nice) but why not take screenshots and show them? B&B also writes on his Instagram and Patreon that he is a regular visitor to Nice. You can easily screenshot this and show it on Imgur and everything is more believable. But here's where it falls down, and makes me doubt some things (btw, Vorkuta is obviously definitely B&B): Oh, you'd like a taster? Well how about the time when Vorkuta boasts of forcing a young hitchhiker to give him a blowjob in exchange for $6. On the threat that if she did not comply he might leave her in the middle of nowhere as they were travelling alone in a car on some deserted highway somewhere in the FSU. You can only imagine how scared she must have been. It was a year since I read it but I think what you've written here is a lie. I remember the story enough, your account isn't true. This is why you should provide sources/screenshots - because when you tell one lie, everything is questionable. I invite you to show the story and therefore show that your account is correct.",

The command prompt window will pop up there and anything typed into it then will automatically go into that folder, as long as you have the yt-dlp .exe copied in there :) It makes it a little faster when downloading everything into one place or even when you want a lot of things to go in specific locations so that they aren't all clustered together in one big spot that has to be sorted out. Once I got the hang of it, I liked it a lot more than the dragging method! It's help with my organization, because it was hard sometimes for me to read where I set the output folder once the downloads began. I always hated having to interrupt it to check if I caught it early enough, or scroll up a ton if it started downloading a lot of stuff really fast and began to blur together haha edit: typo fixed!",

If you look at a list of Finnish municipalities by population you'll see that Helsinki is by far the biggest (650k), followed by 5 cities in the 200k-300k region: Espoo, Tampere, Vantaa, Oulu, and Turku. Espoo and Vantaa I rule out, because they're in the Helsinki metro area, grown into it. Combined the capital region has a population of a little over 1 million, you generally think of it as one unit. It's kinda like San Francisco-Oakland-San Jos\u00e9, three large cities grown into one megacity. Though if the Bay Area is a megacity, the capital region in Finland is a kilocity at most. That leaves out Tampere, Oulu, and Turku. I'd argue that Tampere has the best case for being the 2nd city, since the Tampere region is the 2nd largest metro area in Finland with a population of roughly 400 000 people, but Turku has a pretty good case for itself too, due to it being a more historically significant city. Oulu is larger than Turku, but it's so far north that for people like me who live in the southern parts of the country it doesn't really pass my mind too often. So I guess the answer is no, Finland doesn't have a prominent third city. I'd say that the capital region is the city no. 1, Tampere is 2A, Turku is 2B and Oulu either 2C or 3, whatever you want.",

Seville is growing in importance and cultural influence (and in a economicbasis too). It is the capital of the largest region in population and the second in territory. But even though it has some challenges ahead, the lack of investment, the low possibilities to grow (there are only two, by north or by the villages around it), crime, lowrents and its rivalry with Malaga in tourism, culture and more. I live in Seville and those are the main problems we have to grow. I can't say a lot of Valencia, because I have never been there, lived there or investigated a lot. So if anyone knows I would like to know a little more about the challenges of Valencia. There are also other notable mentions like Bilbao, Malaga or Santiago de Compostela.

The third city in the country is Val\u00e8ncia. For us catalans, Val\u00e8ncia is seen as a culturally similar place to us and what we usually think about when talking about important cities other than Madrid and Barcelona. Nevertheless, though, I get the feeling that for someone from Madrid may feel culturally closer to Seville (4th city) and think of it first in the same situation. In terms of prominence, I'd say that both are perceived as similarly prominent, even though Val\u00e8ncia is larger than Seville.",

It was historically the most important city after Istanbul, and used to be the 2nd city until few decades before. The secular culture and mild climate of Izmir attracts more people every year. 2020 was the first year when Istanbul lost population. While, Izmir became the city with highest immigration. (That's what I remember, maybe I'm wrong on some details.) Istanbul dominates the country in all aspects with its 15 million population. People critize the focus on Istanbul while the other big cities are ignored. Ankara (5.6 million), Izmir and Bursa (3.1 million) are notable cities outside the Istanbul. As I know, Istanbul and Ankara have more job opportunities than Izmir. At least in my career, architecture. Bursa is the major industrial powerhouse and does not fit into your the description either. (but I know nothing much about it to give details) Also, there are other 5 cities larger than 2 million population in Turkey. They are more regional as your description. This number increases to 20 if we look at 1M+ population. Some of them are just really ordinary cities. That's why, it was always surprising to see many important European cities with 1 or 2 million population.",

The battle for 2nd and 3rd is then between the next two settlements, Akureyri and Keflav\u00edk. Both are similar sized but Akureyri usually takes this crown being a beautiful town with a unique sense of identity, a popular destination for locals and tourists alike and a vital service centre for the whole of northern Iceland. (Totally not biased in any way) That leaves Keflav\u00edk as the third city. It's undeniably bigger than the remaining towns, but its home to the airport... and not an awful lot else. Not to mention it has something of \"reputation\" to many Icelanders. It's the place you drive past on the way to/from the airport but you rarely if ever stop there.",

        "Comment": "For the UK as a whole, London and Edinburgh are the two most important by virtue of being capitals. For the third, I\u2019d say Manchester, followed very closely by Glasgow. Manchester makes up the centre of the Northern Powerhouse, the industrial-economic spine of northern England and the Midlands, as well as a keystone between England and Scotland. Meanwhile, Edinburgh may be the brain of Scotland, but Glasgow is the heart - the most heavily populated, most central, and most culturally influential. I\u2019m putting it just behind Manchester purely because it doesn\u2019t connect to the rest of the country in the same way - as a city in itself, Glasgow beats Manchester. If we\u2019re talking about just England, I\u2019d say Leeds-Bradford followed by Birmingham. Leeds is the (informal) capital of Yorkshire, a comparatively vast region of England with frankly immense industrial power; but it also holds most of the north\u2019s media and cultural influence, especially when combined with Bradford. Birmingham, meanwhile, is England\u2019s second-most populous city, and the centre of the English Midlands. I\u2019m placing it behind Leeds-Bradford because the latter has influence over the whole north, while Birmingham influences a smaller area, and has less economic power.",

It can be something totally normal-sounding, yet still be degrading. Is he looking for ideas on what to call you?

Bidens infrastructure spending bill will be a huge tailwind for CVX where over 100000 bridges alone in US are in desperate need of upgrade. Across Canada there are plenty for CVX In Ontario there are 96 bridges in need of repair and could use CVX s revolutionary cement technology. Highways roads and many other areas could use CVX cement technology. International cement giant Lafarge and few other giants are a customer of CVX and or have close associations with one another. Recently 2 institutions have started coverage with a buy recommendation and a target price of $1.25  CVX recently added that by moving some of their big contracts to 2022 they expect to have a revenue well over $30 to $40 mil At .385c CVX is extremely undervalued and perfect time to get in The recently done private placement at .65c has a strike price of .81c This means for institutions to cash their warrants they have to push the stock up to .81c to cash in their warrants So buying now you are easily make over 100%",

While they likely share information with the Kremlin, Russia can't do much with it as I do not live there. I trust the Russian government to keep my information away from the NSA than Google or Microsoft. I might switch fully over to ProtonMail once they release support for the IMAP bridge, but I do really enjoy using Yandex as my email provider.",

Using the glottal stop, a word written as 'uwu' could be pronounced as \u0294uwu\u0294. If punctuation becomes a problem then you could just change the punctuation rules, for example instead of using apostrophes you could use underscores. If looks are not as important to you as sounds you could also use f, which is similar to v and w. You could also use this chart or similar ones to choose sounds that are similar to v and w, or maybe made in a nearby region like m or b.",

A customer calls, he sets an appointment and goes to the house, sees how much the job will cost and gives a quote. At what point does this new business owner salesman hire employees while he is selling to his first customer with no employees and no prior jobs completed? How does he transition smoothly into his first sale, first crew, and first completed project. After that it should be easier (than the initial startup from scratch) to generate a steady flow of jobs to keep the crew busy.",

But I\u2019m just out here doing my usual, 10/10 work...   but my boss really only thinks this ones worth a 7.   But another one easily worth a 9-10.

Often there\u2019s no opportunity because general contractors want your \u201cnumber\u201d before they start to even consider using you. I am a framing contractor and my biggest struggle has been sales. I have plenty of work but the really great jobs always seem to slip through. I absolutely hate the \u201cbidding\u201d process and being compared to other contractors based on only price. There seems to be no way around this because general contractors USE subcontractors for free \u201cestimates\u201d and either dont get the contract themselves or they use whoever has the strongest relationship. I could go on for a long time about how frustrating it is spending hours and hours putting a bid together only for them to not even want to meet with you.",

But there is a heavy amount of competition keeping prices at x per square ft.   And so even tho I\u2019d want $3 a sq ft competitions coming in with $1.50.  And tbh I don\u2019t really know what the competitions coming in at.  And I feel for propper results which is all I want to give, I want to price high.   Like I\u2019m not trying to run a failing business, the intention is to have it become self operating. Or as you say, I don\u2019t even paint but I run a huge operation, and guess what... guaranteed your people are thankful for what you make happen for them.   The customer too.  Being a catalyst is key.  I tell my current boss this all the time too, I\u2019m like .. price higher.  Like it\u2019s never going to grow when your being overly cheap. I\u2019m pretty sure the issue here too is a lot of people do T&M.   AND somehow it gets fucked up in the mix.",

I\u2019m an industrial automation contractor/fabricator/inventor and getting yourself to the point where you are big enough just selling is incredibly difficult, especially in Canuckistan. Finding new painters is easy. Train a guy in a week. It takes half a decade or more to bring someone up to speed on the fine art of industrial machinery and licensed millwrights are rare as can be. And there is another factor. I am doing this because I WANT to. I invent custom parts or whole machines. I\u2019m the guy you call when no one else can figure it out. I\u2019m my own boss and fire customers who annoy me. I make great money for being a 1-2 man show and I don\u2019t have all the bullshit around managing a bunch of people.  There is always this focus on sell the widget sell more widgets grow at all cost. The first time I made money by supplying a customer parts while sitting naked on a beach I was hooked. Sometimes, being issue #1 contractor is a great life. It also has far lower risk because you are doing it yourself and doing it right. Liability can be huge. So can customers burning you in big jobs. My old man has a 18 man furniture shop pumping out hotel furniture. Welp, he did business with a few greedy subcontractors that supplied furniture for a couple of hotels. Well middle men went bankrupt, clever contractors had slippery contracts and he was faced with a wall of lawyers telling him to go fuck himself. He didn\u2019t have the $100k in lawyers it took to fight them (because he got burned for 50% of the bill) and shut his doors. Lost everything. (This was 30 years ago and laws have changed)",

But also so people can straight up choose who\u2019s painting their house ... and at the same time, new hires can operate under the shit brand while your best can operate under the good side, throw in a good one to lead the shit team and Walah. Call me crazy it\u2019s just an idea tho. Lol.    Where the good painter price has level of customer sastisfaction where it\u2019s not done until h they are happy where the other half the \u201cshit\u201d painter price point is as simple as ... you asked for a coat of paint thats what you get regardless. Now obviously the price points would have huge gaps because ones basically warrantied and ones just to slap it on ... but yeah I still wouldn\u2019t know what to price at yet",

So I did or tried and still trying to do what you are doing. That is get the job and source them out to subs/employees.  I have not been successful because my marketing and sales is not strong.  I thought about hiring a marketing/sales but the sales/marketing life cycle is long. So I don't have to pay someone and while waiting for results and keep paying them. How can contractors without sales/marketing background do well in their business?  I know you have a sales background.",

        "Comment": "There are more than enough hard drives on the map to learn every alternative recipe. Having said that, efficiency wise, the best one is the steel ingot one. As it saves a strait 33% or so input resources. The other recipes more depend on making certain things easier. Like screws from ingots. (Same input/output, but it saves one entire production step.). It\u2019s also advisable to pick recipes that replace plastic for rubber. As rubber is more efficient to make. In general, the alternative recipes give you a little bit more output/input as the original ones. But that doesn\u2019t have to be their main advantage. I guess they will do some changes on the recipes in the future. But don\u2019t be afraid to take some you actually don\u2019t end up using, as there are plenty of spare hard drives around.",

        "Comment": "Really early game, I'd suggest ingots to screws.  It doesn't save materials, but it saves an entire production step on anything that requires screws.  But if you're already late-game, you can just remove screws entirely from the chain with different alternate recipes (like stitched plates and caterium computers), so go for those instead. If you're in any way restricted on iron, you should definitely focus on the iron alloy (1 iron ore + 1 copper ore = 3 iron ingot) and alternate steel (1 iron ingot + 3 coal = 3 steel) recipes.  They make your iron go a LOT further.  Add in the iron wire recipe and you can largely remove copper from your production line (except to go into iron and quickwire). Late game, you basically want all of them (with the exception of rubber cable and caterium wire, which are largely useless unless you're REALLY short on copper).  But I'd focus first on the ones involved in the heavy modular frame chain; the chain is long, and every alternate recipe that you add increases the efficiency.  The alternate for Encased Beams and Heavy Modular Frames are great, because they replace steel beams (which take a lot of steel) with steel pipes (which are just slow to make).  At this point I only have one constructor making steel beams for mk3 belts. Basically: If you have the space and power to replace your Smelters with Foundries at the beginning of your production chain, you definitely want to focus on the alternate ingots recipes first, since they make your resources go a lot further.  Once you have those, get the recipes that either remove an annoying resource from the process (like screws and steel beams) or give you a massive efficiency increase (like reinforced plate, modular frame, and heavy modular frame). But your best bet is to spend some time hunting down enough hard drives for all of the alternate recipes before you start implementing them, so you only have to redesign your factory once.",

Good: Heavy Modular Frame Alternate Recipe. Screws makes things easier, same ingredients but saves a production step. I do NOT recommand to use Stator and Circuit Board Alternate Recipe with Quickwire Caterium Computer can be good but need a lot of Caterium.

I'm relatively new to listening so I didn't know that you had made some in the past and only fairly recently came back. They are so good!!! I mean, I don't wanna sound weird or anything but your msub stuff is just... Amazing. Wow; it's all really good. A lot of it brings out the gentle Dom in me tho haha. Anyway I'm glad you've got a masterlist! Giving a listen to the ones bolded was a pretty good idea too :p I'm a huge fan of the aftercare audios as well, mostly cuz it's also really nice to just hear you talk and explain scenarios/your POV.\ud83d\udc9c Edit: also I absolutely relate so hard with the French fry audio. Like... It's not even funny how bad I want some really shitty food sometimes. And the fact that I sometimes get a little bit too excited about food that tastes really good >.<",

        "Comment": "your \"canon ending\" probably isn't canon as its only 2 stars, I believe the princess one is the canon one, you eliminate glitchtrap, cure vanny and escape with freddy as well as it being 3 stars. I believe the unmasked ending is part of your \"canon\" ending since it involves a fire, and the \"canon\" ending alone doesn't make much sense, so on top of that there is probably a springtrap boss fight and/or revival process, my reason being is I don't think freddy would just think to burn down the place just because of vanny, I believe it also has something to do with the discovery of Afton's revival, and seeing how vanny is not in the spring trap cutscene, its safe to assume unmasked and \"canon\" are part of the same thing, as well as that I doubt freddy would have died from that fall. The pizza plex is probably built on top on fnaf 6's remains. In the springtrap ending I believe molten freddy saves springtrap, his face plates opening could be it saying something to springtrap rather than trying to scare springtrap, after all springtrap seemed un phased. They have worked together in the past and its not like molten freddy shares the same goals as the puppet, and being revived just to die to your former ally in such a way is a bit underwhelming, especially for a character such as William, so I gather this would be the worst ending in my opinion if my theory is correct, granted the springtrap \"canon\" ending probably had a bossfight before it due to how damaged springtrap looks despite him being just revived, so we definitely don't have the full story to that ending, and it would be a bit awkward if springtrap just appears, stumbles towards us, and then gets abducted by molten freddy.",

        "Comment": "Okay, I get people don\u2019t like the canon ending but I believe I have an explanation. What we can gain from this leaked ending is Vanny had Springtrap (somehow? maybe the employees referred to in AR and HW had springtrap so they could get the circuit board thing) and that William\u2019s end goal was always to get Vanny to inject remnant inside Springtrap as it would be a waste of resources to make a new body for William considering the Spring-Bonnie suit wouldn\u2019t be as clunky to use anymore due to most of the spring locks and animatronic parts probably burning away in the fire. Now, that leads another question, where did the remnant come from? Well, when given the choice to leave or stay Gregory says \u2018people won\u2019t stop disappearing, will they?\u201d further proven by the missing citizens on the newspaper he sleeps with. I believe it was Vanny that killed them. There also seems to be a larger amount of missing people than the original MCI. I think this is because she didn\u2019t have the time to harvest the remnant over a long period unlike William. Now, onto Molten/Funtime Freddy, this isn\u2019t as deep. I think he was going to be repaired by Fazbear Entertainment, but after finding out the dark history and more so the endless amount of twisted wires, they just gave up. Now, I don\u2019t think William is dead, I believe Funtime Freddy just took him somewhere out of the way. I also believe we are now in the FNaF endgame. I hope to see a game about William\u2019s life and possibly revealing more alive characters, and then one how Vanny came to be and once again revealing more alive characters, with the last being the final showdown against all the protagonists and antagonists.",

Don\u2019t even get me started on the Funtime Freddy thing. Why is he here, it doesn\u2019t make sense in the lore because he burned in the FNaF 6 ending. But most of the characters in the fire have been retconned out of it by miraculously surviving somehow anyway. Steel Wool already ruined the FNaF lore in help wanted and they further tarnished it in this. SB couldn\u2019t even get lore right. What a failure of a game.",

Why did Gregory crawl into Freddy? Why was Gregory at this random kids party if he\u2019s homeless? Why did music man look so small in the vents?

There was this cool program called GASP - Google As Simplified P2P, and you could find damn near all and sundry. Thing is, Google is trying to \"personalise\" searches. Google's engineers are trying to make the search engine search for what they think you meant instead of what you said verbatim ANd the problem with predictive steps is that when you mean what you say precisely, but what you're saying is tres fukken weird, the inferential step will go haywire. Now, combine that with Guggle's market dominance meaning thatif there's an Open Directory, they are more likely than any other engine to get a DMCA link removal request, and you have a perfect soup of Epic Fail.",

Some will have more/better results depending on what they aggregate & where they compile from. Unfortunately google is the 700 lb gorilla in the room and yes, they obv. filter and curate their search results. 2 things I would suggest - try using a meta engine for more results (and hopefully less filtering) and be smart with your search terms and learn how to use the operators . By being smart about the terms I mean know your wishes, for eg. - \"dune\" plugged into your string on google gives vastly different results to \"dune 1984\" (the year it was made). Knowing what you want to search for specifically will not only give you clearer results it will also mean you can adapt your search to get more specific results as well as you go. Gud hunting!",

The Toy Animatronics are created as an additional security measure. I assume you're talking about the FNAF 2 location? FNAF 2 takes place in early November of 1987. That location shut down just after Jeremy had finished his week. The ending newspaper stated \"after being open only a few short weeks...\" meaning that location had opened probably in October of 1987, not 1983. Henry becomes worried that William may potentially try to kill his daughter, Charlie(Charlotte). He installs the Security Puppet at Fredbear\u2019s Family Diner as a protection measure, but William manages to kill her outside the building. At this point, Fredbear's had shut down for at least a few years. It had shut down due to bad publicity stemming from the bite of '83, therefore Fazbear Entertainment purchased their company. In FNAF 2 Phone Guy stated that they were going to try and contact the og restaurant owner from Fredbear's Family diner. He said they had been closed down for years. Also, Charlie was the first of William's victims. She died outside of the first Freddy's location. begins rebuilding Michael as a realistic robot and infuses his body with remnant. I thought this to be the case at one point as well, but it probably isn't what happened. Michael Afton was the older brother and the BV/CC was the younger brother. Michael goes there to find out what happened to his sister, and sees what occurred. Sister Location takes place Handunit states in FNAF SL that Circus Baby's Entertainment & Rental had gained success from FFP's success in the early 80's, and even more so after FFP closed for good in 1993. Meaning that FNAF SL took place just after FFP closed in 1993. Other than that, great timeline! Some sections just need reshuffling, that's all :)",

Get another standard order, and repeat that process, dropping resources into the next piece of road as you go. The more roads you build, it'll be easier to reach new, farther out places, and you gradually progress. Does lake knot, engineer, etc., ever run out of materials? Or do they restock on delivery? I'm trying to find the most efficient way to do this - I like the slow pace of the gameplay, but I'd prefer if it were offset by consistent progress. I'm on Chapter 5 and have only done maybe one or two standard orders. Is this a good place in the game to start taking standard orders?",

I've got it making two 7z files: One using LZMA, one using PPMd (The same compression used by RAR). Then it compares sizes between those and the original RAR, and keeps whichever file is smallest. This is, frankly, overkill. But then that is kind of the point of the script: It *will* make files as small as is possible, no matter how much processor time it takes. Format conversion is disabled by default though. You have to enable it with a command line option.",

Or perhaps loan money to a startup that is working in one of these fields with the hopes of a big payout someday?  Start your own business in one of these fields? When I look at who is making money in legal marijuana for example one of the main groups I see making money is the guys selling penny stocks to people that don't really know the field but just want to dump some money in somewhere. Emerging investments can be very tricky, look what is happening in the solar industry.  Everyone is tripping over themselves saying what a growth industry it is but if you own any stocks in these companies you know that the industry is down by almost 30% in the last year.",

        "Comment": "Especially today, there's always a \"bubble\" in the markets. They might crash tomorrow, or in a year. This carries an inherent risk.  This means some people believe the market is way overvalued, and is due to pop. When investing in tech, you essentially have to throw away any old books on economics. No old-school methods were written with the comprehension of how quickly (and cheaply) tech companies can scale. For walmart to become a nationwide chain, they need thousands of stores, hundreds of distribution centres, an incredibly advanced logistics process, suppliers and employees.....For Netflix to offer their services to 150m customers in Japan, it's some paperwork (okok, way more goes into it, but hardly the walmart scenario). I invested in these companies 3-5 years ago (as soon as I could) and right now if you head to r/investing , they'd run me out of the place for being full of shit and regurgitating the circle-jerk. Either way, if you promise to stay away from that sub, there are convincing arguments why these companies are still in their infancy. TSLA - in 15 years, cars will hardly be a line on their revenue NFLX - even with an extreme P:E, they're just getting started at revolutionizing the entertainment industry. no real competition (yet...be weary) GOOG - they are just getting started. They have almost documented the world's information. SCTY (and other solar).  according to kurzweil, moores law has been steadily seen for solar for 30yr. After 30yr we just hit 1% global usage. Seems minimal, but that's only 14 yrs away from a theoretical 100 capability (of today's output). Cells are getting more and more efficient. 3D printing (DDD, SSYS, XONE) -- I'd say about 10 years before we see 3d printers in the modern home. It will make everything from clothes to replacement parts. 2013 saw a crazy spike thanks to some media hype and well-timed IPOs, but it has crashed significantly. AMZN - no brainer. The future is almost here, and they are well-equipped to handle the next revolution in product delivery. You can easily focus on these giants, and partake in some small-cap companies you feel might be the next \"facebook\". I highly recommend this popular book. Zero to One by Peter Thiel",

Accredited investors must have at least $1m in assets (not including your primary residence) or annual income over $200k ($300k if married). If you clear that threshold you can invest in private companies and there are angel investor groups that help source potential investment options. The ArcView Group is one such and is focused on the cannabis (marijuana) industry.",

The main difference I've noticed is I'm getting really dizzy at the onset of my migraines now. But like I said, they are much shorter.

I'm actually super hopeful. I take so many preventative medications and have 3 different rescue meds.. It's exhausting. I just want Aimovig to work and I'm at the point where I don't even care that I'll have to give myself the shots. My Medicaid might not cover it after the 2 month trial so I'm a lil nervous but why not wait and see.",

Here's my situation: I have headaches 100% of the time, but only a few \"migraines\" per month.  When I say migraines, I am talking about crippling migraine that puts me in bed with an icepack. I recently started getting Botox and my daily headaches have gotten a little better, and I have have had no \"migraines\" in weeks. I can deal with a few a migraines a month - which I don't even have anymore thanks to the botox. What I would fucking LOVE is to fix my daily headaches, but I never really hear any news about that because of the terminology that everyone uses.",

And 16 hours later no problems at all at injections sites. Some dizziness/ wibbly wobbley/ dropping things, but that isn't all that unusual for me since I'm generally in some state of pro or postdrome or active migraine. All that shit just seems to run together. TMI: Did not have my usual \"morning constitutional\" after, so got proactive (as I LOATHE even the slightest bit of constipation) and took a stimulant laxative. Things not moving as usual, but better. Taking another before I go to sleep. Will update with each dose. Good luck to all!",

The FDA is interested in reports of serious or new side effects, not reports of minor side effects that are mentioned in the prescribing information for the drug. If in doubt, I would say report it and they can sort it out. (For example, I would say that the vertigo some people experienced after the injection is something that should be reported.) Here is a link to more information about how to report. This is a totally new class of medication, not a \"me-too\" product, so it's super important that those of you who use it first are vigilant and report any problems. https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/ucm053074.htm",

The 2nd manufacturer hit some hiccups with their plant in S Korea (more of a political issue) nothing with the medicine itself. Should come out in Sept. then the third manufacturer in October, then the last will be December it that one is an IV. She said not a lot of data on the IV Interesting is that there isn't a difference in price between the 70 and the 140. If the prescribe the 140 you get 2 injectors. So she said she is sending in the Rx for the 140 for me!!  Wants me to do the 140 for a couple of months and if I start to really notice a difference then I can do the 70 but will get 2 injections for the price of one. Don't know if Amogen will fix that once the realize it. Let's hope not!  She was originally told it was going to be $50,000 a year, then $20,000 and last year $15,000 so she was happy about the price especially since I do Botox it is cheaper for me to do the CGRP. I am so excited and hope I get the medicine soon!! She also said many people reported being able to challenge themselves with their triggers and doing well with the medicine. For example I can't have any alcohol. It gives me an immediate migraine. So I am hoping in a few months I may be able to have a drink once in awhile!",

He explained everything about it to me, I honestly haven't done much research on it, and he asked if I wanted to stick with what I'm currently taking (topiramate) or try aimovig. I decided to stick with topiramate, even though I'm still experiencing some tingling in my feet. Why did I choose to stick with topiramate? Truthfully, I'm a little nervous about sticking myself with something, though he swore it didn't hurt and it seems like others in this thread have said the same. But I'm also a little hesitant because of the claims of migraines being reduced ~only~ by 50% or more. Before I started topiramate I had anywhere between 17 and 20 days with a migraine. I've been on it for 3 months and this past month I've only had 3 migraines and their intensity was tolerable. So, I'm slightly nervous that if I start something new I'll revert back to having all those migraines and then what if for whatever reason I'm still getting 8-10 migraines a month? I have to go back to my neurologist in 6 months, so from now until then I plan on following this thread (please share your results!!) and other forums where people discuss aimovig to see everyone's progress and then take it from there. Only issue is that a month or so after my next appointment I will be without insurance so if I did want to switch I'm not exactly sure how I'd be able to pay for the medicine. So, like many people have said before, please continuing sharing all of your experiences!",

        "Comment": "I highly doubt this will be seen here, but per Mod direction, here goes: I got a call last week from the Aimovig Ally team, welcoming me to the trail program, etc. I specifically asked when my shot would arrive, and I was told since it was Thursday when they were calling, it probably wouldn't be sent until Monday because of overnight shipping weekend restrictions, blah blah whatever. Ok, fine. So that would have it arriving by Tuesday at the latest. Still nothing today, so I call and now the story has changed to - Oh, oops, we just got your information last week. The actual prescription wasn't processed until yesterday, and it will be at least another 24-48 hours before the pharmacy team calls to schedule my delivery. Which means it will be Thursday again, so we're back at shipping on Monday, arriving Tuesday, if I'm lucky. Maybe I'm just overly cranky about this whole situation, but my head is killing me today and I'm just so ready for any kind of relief. I was told originally from the time they got my paperwork from the doctor, I would have a shot in my hands in 3 business days. I just want to cry. Anyone else having shipping issues with the trial program?",

I currently do not take any preventive meds except for vitamins(magnesium, CoQ10 etc), and I do Botox. The Botox helped but not enough to justify the cost so I will probably stop that once I get the Aimovig. My friend is Austin got her Rx 4 days after me and already got a call about it! I am SO frustrated that it is taking this long!!",

They ordered the med and had it for me next day.  I paid for mine in full as my deductible hasn't been met yet.  It was $569 and change.  I was prescribed 140mg so two shots which i did both in my left thigh.  There is some hot swelling at one of the sites, but not bad.  I agree with others.  It stung while going in but nothing like Imitrex or Sumatriptan.  I feel a little woozy but I also took Rizatriptan an hour ago since today is not a good headache day.  I have daily chronic headache and have for as long as i can remember.  I had my first migraine when i was seven.  My doctor said that the studies were more for migraine relief than for chronic headache, but is hopeful that i will see results in the daily pain.  I never don't have a headache.  It just might be a good headache day or a bad one which will lead to a migraine if i don't attempt to stop it with ibuprofen, then Excedrin and then finally Rizatriptan as it progresses.  Looking forward to following this and hearing how everyone does!  Good luck getting your prescriptions filled and with feeling better!  Oh and btw, this is my first ever Reddit post :)",

I still haven't had a completely headache free day, but my headaches/migraines are less severe, I'm bouncing back quicker, and I'm experiencing more headache-free time each day. This has been subtle physically but has been pretty epic for me mentally. I cannot describe the joy and relief to be able to move through the world pain free even for just a little time each day and be able to focus and to be present. It makes me aware of how much of the time I have been just pushing through and the depths of the anxiety feedback loop living with migraine has created. I'm not free of either right now, but to feel the weight lighten is incredible. It occurred to me as I was saying this to a friend that there is a whole community of people who don't just know my physical pain, but know the mental anguish, the frustration, the constant exhaustion both from the mental and the physical, the anxiety of not drinking enough water or getting enough sleep or sitting next to some A#$hole with too much perfume. And I just want to say that you guys are amazing and strong and whether this drug works or some other drug, or a diet shift or acupuncture or anything, we all got to keep up hope. They say that people feel more effects in months two and three so I'll continue to update.  Much love y'all.",

The artist is using it as an inspiration for their own designs.

We outsource fulfillment on about half our sold items. the company's pricing is fantastic but the lead times are killing us - people just don't want to wait for a month to get their item. So we're debating bringing the whole operation in house, which is gonna cost us about 350K. We'll be able to use the equipment for the parent company as well, but it'll be a market that I'll have to spend time developing, not to mention sticking my neck out and getting more space, people, etc. The more I think about it I'd rather just find a better company to outsource to, dump the parent company and operate as a lean creative company. Do you have any thoughts regarding this? tia.",

There can be many reasons, depends on the  settings and rules the KYC provider was given to follow by the company. Popular Reasons KYC will be declined: Your ID is expired, or has less than a month to expire. You uploaded your ID photos, but during selfie someone else was in front of the camera, behind you or around you. You had your mask \ud83d\ude37 on when started the selfie process. You did not show all four corners of your document. You uploaded by mistake a picture of something/someone else's document. Unpopular Reasons KYC will be declined through many providers: Scanned pictures, black and white or color. Screenshots. Black and white pictures. Any type of editing. Even resizing can be an issue as all images editors leaves data behind in the exif of the photo. You were blacklisted for any reason on the KYC provider. You have a criminal record of any type. You are a public figure. Such as politician, for instance. There are many other reasons though. Source: Just read KYC providers regulations and rules.",

That, or Binance is fucking stupid and their system is wholly incompetent and is run by, incompetent people who should not have jobs. I just keep uploading the same high resolution scan of my ID front and back, it keeps kicking it back because \"your texas drivers license says virginia on it, this ID is from VA not TX even though it says Texas in GIANT FUCKING FONT across the top of it.  Fucking sick of their verification system and stuck in the same shit as everyone else.  I also have run into the issue of \"well we don't support Texas\" and i'm like \"i'm active duty military i havent lived in texas in twelve years you fucking morons, my address, is in WA state.\" US Unemployment was 6.7% in December.

To scare me even further Binance told me my account would automatically lock out in 14 days, so I transferred my crypto to Binance.us and now because they refuse to verify my identity, I cannot transfer, sell, or withdraw anything.

I'm on the part where you need to verify your address with \"bank statement, utility bill, etc\". Easy peasy, I download the .pdf and viola...REFUSED. So I deleted the internet bill and did the same with my electric bill. It was again refused. I don't know how to make a clear document clearer and they haven't shared any specific issues beyond the general \"resubmit and follow these guidelines\". Frustrating for sure!",

When you read reporting, ask yourself what evidence have they used in reporting this story. Are there documents, testimony, multiple sources? Are those sources credible (i.e., do they have a history of lying on record)? If you find the reporting you\u2019re reading to be based solely on speculation and assertion or information from unreliable/bad faith actors then find a better source. Also never get your news from social media posts; read the damn article.",

There are also many cases where using these words does not mean it\u2019s a propaganda outlet. For example, delusional can be used perfectly to describe a situation. For example, thinking the US election was stolen is delusional. That\u2019s not in an inflammatory context to say it as such. It\u2019s only that way to those who are delusional enough to think so. Could it be worded better? Absolutely. Is it wrong? Absolutely not. I think you\u2019re mixing up propaganda with political/emotional charge. Study the history of propaganda, such as the events leading up to Hitler\u2019s reign. The lack of people believing the outlets that called him delusional and crazy and instead everyone believing the \u201cprofessionals\u201d is largely how the public was convinced of lies. TL;DR Just because you don\u2019t like certain words doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re used wrong. Study the sources of an article closely. Never assume something is right or wrong regardless of how it\u2019s worded or where it comes from.",

If one of them gets hurt, she can lay blame at your door because it was your property. your boyfriend's tanning outside puts him at risk of some pretty extreme accusations. The mom already blamed him when her kids burst into your private space without warning. It doesn't seem too much of a leap to say she'll twist facts to make it appear more your/your boyfriend's fault this keeps happening And finally, 4) it's your property. Follow legal guidelines and kick her out. Cold as it sounds, her housing issues are not your concern.",

It doesnt even make sense for Anna to suggest it. Her kids pass time is 100% not your responsibility. I do agree that maybe give her a little longer to find a new place, or even give her a final warning to not make sure that her kids enter your property unasked again. You should not have to feel uncomfortable on your own property, nor should your bf be on edge about sunbathing.",

        "Comment": "Definitely NTA, but there are some legal questions to consider. Number one: does Anna have a lease?  As a landlord you should ALWAYS have your tenants sign a lease.  It protects both of you. If there is a lease, is the period up, or are you going to ask her to move out early?   If so, what are your grounds?   \"I need to use the property for myself or a family member\" is a common reason and is included in a lot of leasing agreements, so you should be good.  If you don\u2019t have a lease, you might find that Anna actually has more rights and is harder to evict. A second question is whether there are laws in place locally about evicting people during the pandemic. What is the situation where you live? Real estate laws vary tremendously from state to state, and from county to county, and if you\u2019re not in the US, I don\u2019t even have a clue how to advise you.",

What kind of documented rental agreement (lease, contract, other) you have with her and when does it expire?  TBH, it doesn't sound like you have reason to terminate before the expiration date. OTOH, you don't have to have any justification to decline to renew it.   If she's just there on a month to month basis, give her 60 days and be prepared to extend it for another 30.

For instance, by offering to pay her first two month\u2019s rent in a new place if she moves out in 30 days, or one month\u2019s rent if she moves out in 60, along with profuse apologies for the inconvenience your family emergency is causing her.

Like yes that is entitled behaviour but is that in your lease? Trespassing may be something more reasonable except you've been letting the children do this for years. It's your job as a landlord to create expectations and communicate those to your tenant. Whether it is legal or not (which it may not be, laws in my area have changed because of the pandemic so check that before doing anything) to make someone homeless when you haven't done that makes you TA. And to make sure I'm crystal clear I don't think her behaviour is okay just that you haven't set up your expectations clearly and making someone homeless without doing this first makes you TA.",

They could still jump the fence, but you could make it harder to get in, which may discourage them and would make it EXTRA their mom's responsibility for not controlling her kids, not yours, if they trespass and see your bf sunbathing again? It's still trespassing and the mom's responsibly without the lock, but it's easier to make a case against the mom holding you responsible for her kids seeing something they shouldn't if you have the property locked out. Depending on the type of fence you may also look into security spikes for the top to prevent climbing, if you're really determined to keep the brats out.",

If she wants a new dog she should get one herself (assuming you okay it.) More than that though, her kids are frequently trespassing on your property, after you spoke with their mother. If them letting themselves in is new behavior then I can guarantee the mother put them up to it. They may have been good tenants earlier, but they are not now. Honestly, I'd tell her the real reason she's being evicted, may teach her not to be that way with future landlords.",

Just be bland and say you\u2019re sorry, but you no longer will be renting to her and need the space. No need to elaborate. Repeat as necessary. Don\u2019t make it messy. Offer to write a letter of recommendation as a good tenant if she\u2019d like. Just follow the legally required eviction requirements- give proper notice, return any applicable deposit amount in a timely manner and all that. That\u2019s it. I understand being worried about her finding a place, but in the end, this is a business transaction, and to be realistic, you are putting your family first and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.",

You can state that you really, earnestly mean this, and if she keeps contacting you about it, you're going to pursue legal means of keeping her from contacting you about non-landlord stuff. Just because you're her landlord doesn't mean she has a right to harass you about your old dog. You may want to talk to a lawyer about this letter before sending it, or possibly have a lawyer send it on letterhead. Her behavior is wildly inappropriate, to be clear, but getting everything down in writing makes it clear how serious it is and might convince her to stop doing those things, or she doesn't, then you have started a file of \"batshit and inappropriate things she is doing\" which will help if she doesn't voluntarily leave and you need to evict her.",

        "Comment": "Well, if you want to know what a penis feels like, (not to be crude) but if you stick something up your ass, you kind of have some what of an idea what it feels like.  It is this feeling of fullness which is quite pleasant, out of your control (not your own hand), but hard to describe.  The most amazing thing though, which you cannot feel from most basic sex toys is the heat. A man's penis gets really hot when aroused, as I'm sure you're quite familiar with.  So you feel the pressure from the insertion itself.  You feel the heat, but what else is great is the rhythm. So from PIV, there are kind of two ways to go at it.  You can have him aim for the G spot, or you can angle yourself so that he hits your clit.  If he hits the G spot, its is more of an intense orgasm.  Typically, it is easier to achieve not in missionary.  Missionary is great for clit stimulation though. Either way, think about how it feels as you are getting to the tail end of a blow job.  Each time her head bobs down on you, your penis contracts pulling more and more blood to the area, until finally you have your moment of release.  That's what happens with women too.  We get hotter and hotter and have that little blip moment of release in our brain and then we start contracting involuntarily. The big differences from PIV orgasms versus like masturbation, is that it feels really good to feel the fullness and heat and pressure of a man's penis on top of the orgasm.  Plus there is the psychological side of \"This man is so into me (literally and figuratively) that he came (or will be coming soon) inside of me.\" The more emotion of that, at least imho is the biggest difference with PIV in comparison to masturbation.  From PIV to fingering or something, not so much of a difference except less pressure from size of inserted body part and by that token, less heat as well.",

So I'd think of skin-to-skin contact with someone's smoothest patch of skin, plus a feeling of pressure from the inside, like an inside-out massage of sorts.  The first entry reminds me a bit of the feeling when a masseuse finds exactly the right spot and presses down on it, except that feeling is radiating from inside you in all directions. Or like a ballon expanding in your abdomen.  Or, if you imagine someone squeezing your penis tightly, except the feeling radiates out from in, instead of in from out... an inside-out squeeze? I disagree with the commentor who said it's like sticking something up your butt; it's a very different sensation.",

The penis is a nice weight and firmness against what I can only describe as \"meaty wetness\" even though that phrase sort of makes me want to heave. A penis feels much better than fingers for me, because of the aforementioned weight and firmness (fingers are far too bony). The first part of my vagina is the most sensitive and it kind of...\"lights up\" when a penis slides through it. You pick up lots of different sensations from the foreskin especially. Beyond that first part, it's more of a stretched, full feeling until you \"bottom out\" which feels like your insides are taking a dip, like when you're on a roller coaster and your stomach drops. I've only climaxed from penetration alone a handful of times. It was good, but much less intense than clitoral orgasms are for me. Less satisfying as well. Sort of like...diffused vaginal throbbing that sent gentle pleasure radiating upwards in waves from my vagina.",

        "Comment": "Edit: Looks like the suggestions from this comment has been implemented. Thank you for listening! Having a FAQ section is good for this sub, but there are a few issues I'd like to point out: I just beat a boss but got no completion mark, why did this happen? I think the \"change the character during the run\" bit should be clarified further. Not every new(er) player is aware that dying with Ankh, Lazarus' Rags and Judas' Shadow respawns you as ???/Lazarus/Judas respectively, so they may not be aware about the character change. I had a 100% angel deal chance but still got a devil deal. How did this happen? The current answer does imply it's a bug, but \"the angel room stats don't add up properly\" is a bit vague. All the other bonuses add up properly to 95.25%. It's the Sacrifice Room's \"You feel blessed!\" bonuses that cause the chance on Found HUD to become 100%, regardless of all the other modifiers. It should be clarified in the answer. How do I get ... to appear on my HUD? MissingHUD 2 can still be used with older versions of Isaac, so it should be mentioned here. Other than that, there are some grammar/spelling mistakes in the text (ex. lowercase \"repentance\" in the beginning, missing dots and spaces, \"play on exclusively hard mode\" should probably be \"play Hard Mode exclusively\", etc). They aren't critical to the FAQ, but fixing those would probably be better for reading experience.",

        "Comment": "\"Gregory, come back, it was just a glitch.\" implies that Gregory was willingly with Vanny at some point, and she was trustworthy, but something happened with her that made her seem untrustworthy, which made him start running from her. We also see footage of Gregory in an elevator going away from guard Vanessa while she looks worried about him. The datamined AR emails directly point out that Spoiler alert. Click to see Help Wanted set up the concept of a woman in a tech position dealing with Glitchtrap's ability to possess a human who interacts with him. The Tape Girl finds out he can do this and warns the player, one of the endings has the player get possessed by him, and the Reluctant Follower easter egg involves a woman already possessed by him. That's 3 mentions of Glitchtrap possessing someone. I highly doubt that's for no reason. We have the sun/moon animatronic that is one character changing states back and forth, which makes a solid parallel to Vanny switching between her normal self and the evil version possessed by Glitchtrap. There has been a lot of groundwork laid for the idea of Vanessa switching between normal and possessed, and dealing with the frustration of trying to protect a kid while also unable to control the fact that she will become his attacker at different times. Unconfirmed, yes, but there are a billion and a half big red arrows pointing to this being the conceit of the game. The animatronics probably only attack when you play as her in her guard mode, because they know she's trying to kill Gregory in some capacity. The emails also seems to imply that Spoiler alert. Click to see So from the information that we have access to so far, the implication is that Gregory is running from Vanessa because a part of her is trying to kill him. Even she is aware of this, and she is trying to fight the possession to get him to safety. The animatronics are trying to get him away from her entirely and eliminate her, it seems.",

The last part does not imply here, but it's a good theory that though they sound different...Vanessa and Vanny are the same person and Gregory knows this by the way Vanessa varies herself. Therefore, in my belief, that's why Gregory is hiding from the guard.",

It seems that Vanessa is trying to help Gregory get out if the Pizza Plex (based off of what she says in the gameplay trailer) so it could be that Gregory doesn't want to leave just yet. I believe in one of the trailers Vanny mentioned something about Gregory's \"friends,\" which could mean that Gregory has some friends who may also be trapped in the Pizza Plex. If this is true, it could be assumed that Gregory would want to save them and not leave without them. My other theory is that Gregory is hiding from Vanessa in fear of her. I think Vanny and Vanessa are the same person, evidence being the emails in Special Delivery (+ any other evidence I may be forgetting right now, its 1AM so just point out any mistakes I might be making.) In the trailer you can hear Vanny telling Gregory that she's sorry for losing her temper, that it was just a glitch. This could mean that Gregory was with Vanessa at some point before she \"lost her temper\" and caused Gregory to lose trust in her. My last theory doesn't really have any evidence I can think of, just something I think could at least be possible. Maybe this part takes place earlier on in the night, before Vanessa tries to help Gregory out. Maybe Gregory is just hiding from her because he thinks he could get in trouble or doesn't want to be caught, considering he probably shouldn't be there since its closed and nobody should be there.",

        "Comment": "Well aside the fact that it's entirely possible for Vanessa the security guard and Vanny the stabby bunny are the same person... Which lean that way from clues so far It's also possible Gregory isn't sure about her. For whatever reasons the kid stayed behind to solve... Be it trying to save his friends that went missing, or figure out what is going on with the animatronics he may have noticed, Gregory doesn't want to get caught until he does what he deems needs to be done. It really depends on who he runs into first, Vanny or Vanessa that may change a few theories. Again Gregory could be unsure about her because... There's this creepy lady in a Bunny suit with a knife glued to her hand, running around the joint and this security lady is focused on finding him persistently rather than call the police to get them over here to deal with the maniac while looking for said killer. Maybe but who knows. If that scene takes place after him finding the security office and finds some clue or dead body there of a guard then there just happens to be a second one, he might see it as 'security lady is bad juju' and stay away from her until he is sure to trust her. It could also be a possibility of mistaken identity of hearing Vanessa's nickname be Vanny. And there's a killer bunny bitch named Vanny, if it's a cas of hero and villain with the same name/nickname. And he doesn't see them in the same place at the same time always at different intervals. So he could mistake them as being the same person, because there's a lot of women named Vanessa/Vanny in the world. So until he's sure, he stays away from both and trusts only himself and Glamrock Freddy. Just different theory nuggets rolling around in my head. All possibly wrong but still kinda fun to share.",

Vanessa in her nightguard form could have her bunny or \"Vanny Costume\" underneath. Just think she could just take her take her night guard uniform and the Vanny costume would be under it. Vanessa would do it out of sight so Gregory can't see that she is Vanny. This picture of Gregory hiding from Vanessa is probably after or when he discovered she was actually Vanny if he did. But that's just a theory....",

He\u2019s probably hiding because he doesn\u2019t want to get in trouble for most of the first night (assuming that security breach is going to have multiple nights), until he sees something weird, don\u2019t know what though. Out of curiosity he comes back night after night trying to figure out what\u2019s going on, all while hiding from Vanessa so that he doesn\u2019t get in trouble for the first couple nights, until he eventually figures out Vanessa is Vanny, which gives him yet another reason to be hiding from her. This is just a guess though.",

I mean, she could totally pull a Bane and go \"Nobody cared who I was until I put on the mask\" The only problem with that is we know Vanny worked on the VR game. She gets possed by Glitchtrap, and starts wearing a bunny suit. We don't know if Vanny becomes a security guard just to get closer to her victims. The other thing is Vanny and Vanessa could have the same build. Another problem to the \"Vanessa is Vanny\" theory is the statue by Funko. It depicts Vanny doing a \"shushing\" pose while Vanessa is crouched behind a bush almost hiding from Vanny.",

It only works in Creative mode because it just places the blocks and doesn't consume any items. You use it by positioning the placement where you want it, and then use the executeOperation hotkey, while in the Paste mode. Note that you also need to be holding the \"tool item\" for the hotkey to work, as a safety feature so that you don't accidentally activate it while doing something else. The \"Schematic Rebuild\" mode is a bit badly named, it basically allows you to edit the schematics themselves, by allowing you to \"rebuild\" stuff in the schematic by breaking and placing and replacing blocks. I will probably rename it to Schematic Edit mode instead in future versions.",

I don't think combining or removing leagues has that big affect on playability.  Combining especially if you see them in the same frequency whats the difference playing. Sure it one less name to remember, but if it's the same frequency your still engaging with mechanic at the same rate.  Is knowing one extra name that hard? Is combining the slightly different mechanics really needed?",

I feel that ritual for instance is a lot more manageable with its density and non scaling difficulty. Unfortunately without any cool boss uniques, it's a bit of a missed opportunity in regards to the vessels The floor requirements on a build to finish a full waves Ultimatum is a tad higher imho. If memory serves well, the rippyness of ultimatum was brought up more often than that of ritual. Even if this won't concern everyone- the separation of the individual ritual encounters is welcomed when paired with delirium. I think that if ultimatum would put you in a smaller version of the inscribed arena to deliver the same density, there wouldn't be that many complaints left about the similarities to ritual.",

Are you seriously going to tell me that you wouldn't be hyped to see this concept? I don't think it would need a lot of work too. Synthesis 2.0 could also be cool, taking all the lessons they learned from the first iterations and making it actually fun. The idea of collecting memories is really cool, but it would need a cool twist to make it interesting. What if we got rid of Heist and instead we could mix the two for a cool Inception League? Heist memories: no more alert bulls**t, just fight your way through the subconscious until you reach the memory, than you enter the memory and you get the synthesis encounter (and no more closing in mechanic, that wouldn't be necessary). I can believe our exile would try to heist memories to help the dude recover his memory, rather than join a thief's guild.",

Could benefit from just a simple buff like dropping MORE splinters !!! Other than that, its cool to farm legion how it is and tryong to go into legion domain, and same for breach, a slight boost to make it a bit more compeling, like simple boost the base density as well as density with tier would already be a nice touch. Then going into breach domain are hell fine for exp actualy, the problem is just that you dont drop enough splinter so its not much fun because of that. I would  love to see some kind of synthesis maze re use one day, but in a more engaging and smooth way. I found the league interesting back int he day but clearly not enjoyable in any aspect because of execution",

Yep, that sounds good to me. I am actually hyped about Ultimatum coming back, never has a league shaken the meta this hard before. It was actually quite hard building a character for it.",

Imagine if*upon touching a breach, half a legion of frozen enemies also spawned (rarely) and you have to break them before the breach collapses, or you touch a ritual altar and a surprise breach opens on top of you at the same time. Entering an incursion sometimes has it also being invaded by beyond monsters. Betrayal fortifications unleash bestiary monsters from cages to fight you.",

Expeditions in map would stay as they are, but have a very low potential to drop Heist loot (gems, items, trinkets, NPC items etc).  Logbooks would no longer be outdoors, they would be in the Grand Heist areas.  You would utilize the Heist NPC similarly to how they function now to open doors with chests behind, but along the way you would need to drop your explosives for the chests, rather than opening them on the way to final room.  Once you have run out of explosives, it would detonate from last to first, taking you back through to the entrance.  No more doors to open on the way out, but enemies would still pour out like they do in Heists.",

        "Comment": "I like the ideas I'm seeing in the comments and think these are some great suggestions. Personally I'd go with: Vaal side areas + scourge tainted currencies Harvest removed and crafts spread throughout Delve fossils (change resonators to respect meta mods), Bestiary, and Incursion Temple (fossils for reforges, beasts for augments and fragment exchanges/upgrades (offerings, scarabs, etc), and temple for things like currency conversions, div card gambles, and gem awakening gambles through sacrifice altar). Tempest + Domination for shrines that spawn tempests. Possibly have corrupted tempest as a sextant shrine. Torment + Abyss like is posted in the OP. Lair of the Wolven King (Rigwald boss) portal added to Bestiary with Eyes of the Greatwolf added to Rigwald's loot table. Ultimatum added as a room encounter in Incursion Temples. Ambush and Warbands added to Rituals for a chance at exiles and warbands to be protecting the altars. Delirium added as a node variant in Delve, functioning similar to the harbinger node where you fight waves of delirium monsters in a single location, having a chance to drop cluster jewels or delirium uniques based on depth level (boss spawns for chance at unique drops). Beyond and Rampage like suggested in OP, with rampage buff duration adjusted slightly to only account for stacks increasing only from beyond monster kills. Leave Breach untouched. It works fine as is and is fairly well balanced. It is also integrated into other content already. Legion can go untouched as well. Similar to Breach but very different lore so combining them doesn't make sense to me. Already well integrated into Incursion and Delve zones. Besides adding some older league mobs to Ritual zones, I think Ritual is fine as is. A big ritual encounter in Incursion and Delve would be nice. Perhaps have a chance to find blood vessels in ritual themed reward chests instead of just splinters. Synthesis returns. It's important lore and a fun concept that felt great to play once the kinks were worked out. For balance concerns can lock memory encounters in maps behind sextants or a watchstone mod. Can also add it as a Zana craft outcome from harvest (which would be moved to either Incursion or Bestiary). Give access to the Memory Nexus once the player has defeated Shaper (or perhaps Elder), lore being that their defeat causes a flood of memories to be unleashed and Zana remembers an alternate timeline (Synthesis League) which reveals the location of the nexus to her. That's all I got for now.",

        "Comment": "I feel like they could combine Strongboxs and Ultimatums pretty effortlessly, especially since they're basically the same mechanic. You go up to a strongbox, Ultimatum guy shows up, offers you the strongbox loot AND a chance at something else he offers IF you can complete the Ultimatum ..or you just get what's in the box. Bake scourge currencies into other vaal areas, especially Atziri. Expedition maps, blight maps, guardian maps, etc. just drop as part of the normal map pool. Torment, invasion, warbands, etc. are fine as normally spawning mobs in areas; they just need a more profound place as an entity with predictable loot improvements.  Something that makes you want to chase after them / engage with them, and far less like a white mob with boss level difficulty and nameplates. Instead of legions, breaches, incursions, etc. all needing a special activation and gimmick ...just make them roaming groups you run into, maybe even a designated \"area\" they patrol or stay near ( like breach mobs staying near a breach portal ).  Remove the need for an arbitrary engagement mechanic ( like killing legion mobs to activate them before the timer ).  Heist had a good system of this sort of random grouping of enemies and placing them in strategic points, you can do that with most enemy types. We really don't need leagues / game mechanics like Heist, betrayal, delve, etc. that distract players from the core part of the game to run off for a moment and get nothing.  Nor the incessant need to \"bank\" encounters in order to enjoy them like normal content.  They should be removed and actually baked into the core game ( like the rewards ) ..or made into alternative leveling / mapping content without restrictions in a generic form.  If the endless events have pointed out, these things work just fine as a standard way to play the game ..their entire hiccup is that they still try to \"Be\" that league only.  If they were just opened up as parts of the game you can do instead and get the same reward structure as something else, it would add to the game without being a clunky diversion of necessity. In general, all of the league content can be baked into each other or as a similar new mechanic, that ensures the players are playing the core part of the game, without them being the obtuse mini-games they are now.",

        "Comment": "I had a few ideas like this a while ago Combine Abyss and Delve having sulphite as part of the reward from the Abyss event in zone, faster clear = more sulphite with the baseline clear being roughly equivalent to what you would get from 3 nodes now, still affected by map quant? Have Niko show up when you have an abyssal depths and tell you to watch out below and get the trolley to follow you in an instanced Delve zone themed to the boss at the end incorporate all the bosses from both leagues into the abyssal depths AND the mines themselves, weighting on rarity applying as you'd expect Combine Prophecy and Incursion use silver coins to apply modifieres and/or reroll at Alva spawns? Maybe Navali can do that in town as well? IE if you haven't finished your 12 temple events then she can reroll or add them but still doesn't guarantee that you'll run whatever room she has rerolled (or can she for a high fee...) use coins to upgrade to Fated uniques in Sacrifice room or whatever it is Combine Talisman and Beastiary Remove Talismans Combine Breach and Essence Touch the Essence to open the Breach, essences now drop from breaches dependent on the type that was shown in the Essence monolith while also adding modifiers to the Breach monsters depending on what the essences were surely there's some synergy between types of essences and the 5 breachlords that could be established And here's a wild thought I've had just now, combine Scourge and Synthesis Give us the nexus back but give us a krangle button so that any module we place on the map can instead give us the Scourge version of it, or if they want to make nodes drop like maps, make corrupted ones krangle nodes if a node is krangled, it might be cool if it leaks into neighbouring tiles, this being calculated as you add more tiles to the chain so you could potentially keep adding to a chain with krangles in it and make them all scourged put the items you want to scourge into the nexus device as well (I can't remember exactly how the nexus device worked for synth items but they both do implicits right?) if there has to be a timer on the tiles then surely the memory hole close logic can apply to the scourge bar at a similar rate IE if the node would close because of its native timer then that would probably equal the amount of time the scourge zone would stay open We know Cenarius has the only alternate reality where the Scourge didn't win so that's at least a neat lore tie in Could probably come up with other ideas but I'm spent for now",

        "Comment": "Some points: Prophecy and Perandus have been the only removed mechanics so far (in the sense of mechanics that got added to the core game and then got removed), I wouldnt say any of those were actually popular. Your first sentence sounds like you are stating they were, if thats not the case, then just ignore this point. The ritual+ultimatum combo sounds quite good, that could be a nice starting point for trying the idea of combining. Legion and breach wouldnt make sense in a thematic sense, the whole thing about legions is waking up past time armies, which wouldnt make much sense that they fight some other dimension and current-time demons. Gameplay wise could work, but you would have to at least make some different breach rares (currently there is like 1 type of rare for each breachlord army, while there are like 3 for each legion army). The bit that people said that ultimatum looked similar to ritual before the league launch doesnt sound like a good argument. I mean, that is just an impresion from someone that hasnt even been able to play the league, things can look similar and be quite different. I say the gameplay feels kinda similar (except that there are different modes for ultimatum, while ritual is just kill) but the reward structure is way different. A stronger point would have been making that distinction and combining them not by looking similar, but by combining the strongest points that each mechanic has: Gameplay for ultimatum, rewards for ritual. This way you open the combination posibilities way more than making them combined just because they feel similar.",

Anyway Op said ultimatum not rewarding yea shiting 4-15c every zone was not rewarding almost 100% guaranteed . I like ritual better since it offers me synthesys items . Their combat is similar thou and i wont mind doing all the rituals from a single location , maybe even in one go . Some leagues can go , the boss mechanics can be preserved in other shapes and formes . Talisman is not in the game for years now , but its always in a box from a league mechanic  somewhere .",

Maybe combine some crafting methods, or create an additional npc/device to use different methods combined. Also important, finding a way to reduce the time needed for everything, like they did to the atlas. Lab takes too much time in comparison to the rewards and the random chance of getting a good enchant. Repeating the Acts each time a character is created, at least recycle the waypoints. A new system for sockets/links will be appreciated as well, 6-linking is rough. And much more.",

Then the anime/manga community derived the term 'loli' as a generic word for an underage girl (or one who appears physically immature), particularly a fictional anime/manga character and particularly if they are portrayed in a sexual way not conventionally considered appropriate for their childlike appearance. Is he straight up asking if I am underage? Or if you have a youthful appearance, like that of a girl who is underage. How creepy is this on a scale of 1-10? Depends on context. But if it's not obviously a joke, then I'd say it's pretty creepy.",

You're paying expenses all year just to hope that none of your players get sick in time for TI, etc. People have been talking about for years and years now. The DotA esports scene is ultimately good for Valve and a risk for everyone else. Which is nuts, because Valve has other esports which don't have this problem.",

It hurts to say, but that pretty much sums up how attractive this game is for orgs. On top of this,  Dota  players are selfish ( Can't find a PPd tweet anymore, but he basically mentioned it before and I can only agree). They do nothing to promote the game  ( mainly Valves fault though ). Kuro and Puppey basically cashed in, started their own org. Never stream, 0 content. And they are considered as goats in dota. Nobody outside the Dota bubble knows who they are . NA's favorite and legendary Rtz has one tweet in a month , rarely streams, 0 engagement at all considering his reach. Although I don't watch him, nobody can deny that Gorgc is by far Dota's biggest amabassador at this point.",

Cloud9 & Complexity pulled out a while ago. Every other region has a much larger player base, a growing esports culture, and lower cost of living. On the other hand, the US is expensive, has a dwindling dota player base and the esports scene is kind of lacking. On top of that, NA teams tend to be cross-continental, and flights within the US are expensive too. Flying everyone out for bootcamping must be expensive as fuck. Now you take the fact, that NA teams rarely stay together (except EG) and have a rather terrible reputation for being assholes, and you are looking at an incredibly uphill battle towards sponsorship. It's a shame cause, this QC team looks like a good lot, without any scandals, whose players are marketable as streamers and have been putting out great performances. Alas, the realities of money can be brutal sometimes.",

Valve has a strange strangle hold on the scene that is different from Riot's method of controlling their esports scene. Valve wants teams to be organic, player-made organizations. But that leaves teams to be underfunded and easy to be exploited or taken advantage of by managers. Look at how many pro players have been caught match fixing. And even Team Spirit's owner/management is refusing to say who it's financiers are. This kind of system benefits Valve. They have a buffer of responsibility when a team goes and does something sketchy. Valve can say they have no hand in what teams do. But when you're encouraging this kind of system, it's hard to say you have no part in it.",

        "Comment": "My suspicion is that Quincy Crew fall into this awkward category where a sponsor would make a loss sponsoring them, and the players would probably make less due to how skewed TI's prize pools are. Quincy Crew finished in the top 12 at TI10, which I think is still a perfectly-admirable result.  Additionally, they are either top 2 in NA (top 3 at worst), which means there's a reasonable chance that they are going to Majors and TI.  Assuming they do get to TI, as long as they avoid finishing last in groups, they get top 16 or top 12.  Both would pay out about six figures per player, which is decent money, albeit not that spread-out over the year, and with an element of risk (what if they finish last in their groups?). To be worth it, Quincy Crew will need to assume that the extra support they will get with a sponsor will translate into the next step up at the very least.  But can Quincy Crew make top 8?  OG and T1 finished 7th-8th, and that is a very hard nut to crack.  While I think it might be possible, this is far from guaranteed.  Finishing top 6 and above?  As much as I love watching these guys play, I think this is really aspirational, and they haven't shown that quality yet. But even if they finished in the top 8, that only translates to 25% more prize money at TI.  This naturally limits the sponsor's cut to 20% (plus 25%, minus 20% puts you back where you started).  It's also far from guaranteed, so a sponsor would want something closer to 20%.  Then the sponsor would need the players to take part in more media activities, which cuts into practice time.  And if they take 20% but finish in top 12 again?  Well, the players make less money, unless the sponsor shells out the difference. I can see why it's really hard to secure a deal for Quincy Crew, from both ends.  This also applies to every single NA team, except EG, who have venture capital and fingers in many pies, so the Dota team can be a loss-leader (and EG are capable of making a profit if they hit, say, top 4). This basically boils down to the structural issues in the NA scene - a lack of tournaments, a smaller playerbase (although there is definitely a chicken-and-egg sitation here) and high costs of living.  As an example, Quincy Crew made about $200,000 in prize money in COVID-hit 2020 (mostly finishing 1st/2nd in all tournaments) - but Team Secret made $200,000 alone by winning WePlay's Omega League Immortal Division. What would ideally happen is that Valve takes money out of TI and puts it into the leagues.  This would give players more breathing space financially, which means they would demand less of sponsors/organisations.  This would let them put infrastructure in place (like Complexity/Cloud9 once did) to run teams.  More money might also encourage more players at the top to play competitively.  All will hopefully translate into a healthier NA scene in the long run. I don't think this is restricted to Dota, either.  Many NA teams in other games have similar constraints, and their results on the worldwide stage show. There is another elephant in the room - sponsors in Dota and esports in general are pretty dodgy, and I wouldn't be surprised if it's all money that could dry up in the future.  We can already see how many betting companies are involved in Dota, some of whom are based in questionable places.  For all we know, the NA scene might actually be the healthiest in this regard, because it lacks the hype that encourages grey money to be thrown around.  To that - I again point at Valve to open its wallet.",

For example yawar and ccnc have esport earnings beyond 600k$ in the last 4 years. thats more than 100k$ per year, which is like more than enough for a single guy to live off of. At this point they most likely bougth houses and dont have to pay anymore rent. So the fix costs would be like water/gas/electricity which is negligible. Just start over, give yourself a \"proper\" name, get a few sponsorships in and live off of those for a starter you can start with a gambling site, like every team has, they pay shitloads of money anyway. I mean this is exactly what Secret, OG, Nigma are doing. And with that model they made their own org, Secret and OG have now teams in multiple esports, but originated from Dota2. Im not sure what 2-5k$ monthly salary is gonna change, nothing is gonna change. 99% of your cash will come from TI and let's be honest if you aren't losing to some SA team you will get loads of cash. QC got 9-12 and got 800k for a 2week tournament.  even 13-16 got fucking 600k. So basically qualiyfing for TI means you can live the good life, and lets be real here, na is absolutely shittier, they will always qualify to every major/TI. And yeah the majors are also some nice pocket money, maybe to buy a small flat to rent out or buy a nice car. There are SO many possibilities I really don't understand why they still want an org, unless its some super established org like Liquid, who are in esports since two+ decades.",

        "Comment": "People saying Dota system is bad don't know what they are saying. Dota system basically the same as League now but better since we get 3 international LANS and one TI while in League they only got 2 IIRC. If you compare the viewership of NA league for dota and LoL its like x3-5 gap but if you look and compare how much investment orgs are shelling out for their LoL team its like x20-40 since they also need to pay franchise fee. Don't even say NA LoL orgs are that much profitable with their revenue sharing with Riot a lot are of NA orgs are operating at a loss with their esports lol team. So why does Orgs in NA don't want to touch dota. The old system sucks for them since mostly it is a player base system where players are the kings and can leave orgs without repercussion. (It is somewhat fix now with this league system) So maybe this orgs still don't know about this and still think we still have the same old system. Orgs in NA invested a lot on LoL that investing on its rival can devalue their investment on LoL. This is basically basic business move you don't invest on a rival brand if you invested a lot on a product already since it would somewhat devalue your biggest investment and most NA orgs biggest investment is LoL. Orgs can just autopilot on LoL franchised system and still get money and marketing. Orgs can just leech out from the Riot franchise revenue sharing system and Riot are x100 better at marketing their product than Valve. NA big orgs get their sponsorship mainly because of content creation not mainly because of Esports hell the top orgs don't even have a good team in LoL or don't even focus on Esports at all. Honestly I can probably add more why Dota esports system right now is better than LoL specially in NA if you base it in viewers to spending ratio.",

OG, Nigma and Secret are organizations now I suppose, but they started as just player owned teams for DOTA2. With how franchised leagues don't exist in DOTA2, I don't see any reason for teams to seek sponsorship from established organizations. QC can seek their own sponsorships without having to get picked up by a Complexity or whatever. It's what OG, Secret, and Nigma did. The DOTA2 scenes prize and league structure does not require or reward multi-game large organizations continued existence. Other scenes do.",

I'm sure QC will demand high salary because they are top seed in NA (I'm not saying they don't deserve it) but with mediocre LAN performance, they will likely to earn only enough from winnings... Orgs will probably be in breakeven at best.  Plus, even if they qualify to TI with an org. Org won't benefit as usually it's 70-30 of the prize earned.",

        "Comment": "This method is pretty rough around the edges and can be a bit stress inducing at times, but the way I defeated her was by doing this. Make Omori sad using either his ability Sad Poem or having a member (preferably Kel) use the Poetry Book item. Always keep him sad as his stab ability is not only stronger against happy enemies when he's sad, but it also ignores defense. It does around 153 dmg per hit, around the same as hackaway, just more cost efficient in terms of juice. It might not be the same for everyone, but for me Sweetheart targeted Aubrey the most out of everyone in my team. So make sure she's always using her Counter ability, or guard if she's out of juice that turn. Kel is the most important part of this strategy. Giving him the cat ears equip is also vital to making him faster than Sweetheart (well, until she reaches the ecstatic phase). He'll be healing Aubrey so she doesn't die and so Sweetheart will keep targeting her. Make sure you have a lot of pocket snacks that can heal 60% or more health, Ramen is a good one and I got a lot from the Overworld. Also, bring a lot of group healing items incase Sweetheart uses group attacks. Hero is the slowest one of the party, but using his fast food ability can help out if Kel is in danger of becoming toast by a group attack and Sweetheart is in her Estatic phase. You can also use his tea time ability to replenish Omori's juice and health if he ever runs out, aswell as using group juice replenishing items. Bring lots of mango smoothies, im pretty sure the smuggler in the dungeon sells them for around 200 clams each? Also, use jacks against Sweetheart so her speed will gradually get lower and lower so Kel will be faster compared to her when she's in her ecstatic phase. Hoped this helped ^",

My strategy was to simply get Omori furious and hack away. I would use Kel's annoy skill to make him angry, and Sweetheart would use the attack called 'Insult' which would make Omori even more angry. And obviously, i had Hero heal every now and then. I used a lot of juice powerups and healables. Edit: Aubrey just guarded, i tried making her angry with Kel so she can do Headbutt, but Omori's hack away done like 110 damage (multiply by 3)",

At least that how I\u2019ve heard it works from some videos on YT. Sad to see a well liked game being brought down by somebody.",

You can probably get yours working, given enough effort, since these printers are all pretty much the same. However, when buying a budget printer, it is a good idea to \"go with the herd\" and buy the most popular one. That way, you can be reasonably sure of not buying an absolute clunker, and there will be plenty of community support when problems occur.",

The \"X3S\" is the same thing, but with a few upgrades: Auto Bed Level, USB connection, Heated Bed and Thermal Runaway Protection. That being said: In assembly it is very important to assure snug fitting of all parts.  Also, be sure to use good quality PLA, etc because there is some crap out there that no printer can effectively use.  The grinding noise you hear is likely the feeding mechanism being too tight and it's crushing the filament, making it struggle to fit through the teflon tube.  I had loads of issues due to using the cheapest PLA I could find: it broke in about 10 different places inside the feed tube, burned in the hot-end and even had one type that was manufactured at almost 2.0mm and destroyed my PC4 fitting.",

Are people seriously believing he wasn\u2019t planning to come prior to Dec 16?  Because before he very luckily got asymptomatic COVID right in time to qualify him for what he thought was a vaccine exemption, he actually had no way of being accepted into the AO. Because we all know he was never going to get vaccinated. And even if he was possibly planning it, he wouldn\u2019t have had time from Dec 16 to get fully vaccinated with booster dose requirements for all but J&J. Surely he\u2019s not that much of a sociopath that he\u2019d knowingly go out with COVID. My bet it it\u2019s a false result.

If so, that would point to Tennis Australia doing something fishy to let him play. But more importantly, I think the doubt on the doc is warranted. I noticed he said \u201cNovember\u201d in the interview, but it could easily have been a mistake. But it\u2019s also suspiciously close to the actual tournament\u2014what was he gonna do if he didn\u2019t get Covid in December? Of course, it also coincides with when Omicron really broke out, so it would have been a more likely time for him to contract it.",

Novak is tight with the government and did a fuckton of favors for them. For six months he's been saying that he plans to play, and his idea was \"I'll just forge a document that I had covid in December\". Hope he does get deported, that's idiotic behavior and insults intelligence of so, so many people. edit: OMG THEY PUT DJ IN HIS NAME BUT \u0106 IN THE END AND HIS NAME IS IN LATIN ALPHABET WHILE THE REST OF THE DOCUMENT IS IN CYRILLIC ARE YOU KIDDING ME edit 2: There's no way this is a real document, right?

Scott, you did a mistake by scrapping this screenplay. A very big mistake. Totally disappointed. jk But hey  you could make a spinn off game about it y'know man The \"Cassidy\" screenplay Verdict: Ultimately more of a visual encyclopedia than a movie, this just wasn't satisfying, even to me. Out. Honestly I totally agree with this. Having a movie that would just be... basically about explaining stuff of the games doesn't feel that satisfying to me neither, and newcomers to the series or people who are unfamiliar with FNaF, or heck even fans theirself who aren't that appasionate with the lore would just be confused the hell out of this. It's really better just having a simple concept and plot for a movie of this series. Although a pretty basic setup, there were a lot of odd choices here, which only got weirder as the story continued. The story ended with our protagonists in a secret underground animatronic factory that was designing robots for the government. -___- ...what Oh right, so onto the bad news. The bad news is that there won't be any more screenplays to add to this list since we're officially making the \"Mike\" screenplay. Awesome. Can't wait for it! Filming starts in Spring!!! :D HECK YEAH!!. Edit: hold up... just realized... did you really just trolled us after a really long time?",

        "Comment": "The \"F\" screenplay Basic Setup: Group of teenage trouble-makers break into Freddy's; chaos ensues Problems: Although a pretty basic setup, there were a lot of odd choices here, which only got weirder as the story continued. The story ended with our protagonists in a secret underground animatronic factory that was designing robots for the government. -___- Verdict: WT@#$@ Strayed way too far from source material! Tossed. ngl i would watch this. sure it strayed way too far from the source material but when the fazbear frights books exist this is tame in comparison. The \"Plushies Take Manhattan\" screenplay Basic Setup: Plushies take Manhattan. Problems: Plushies took Manhattan. Verdict: Burned with fire. sounds like a fun movie, would probably watch The \"Random Charlie\" screenplay Basic Setup: Charlie and friends sneak into Freddy's after-hours to retrieve a lost toy. Problems: Although sharing names of familiar characters from the series, these characters had nothing to do with their game and book counterparts. So, while featuring familiar elements of the games, it seemed too \"loosely based\" on the game, and lost a lot of its impact because of it. Verdict: Felt like a random bag of FNAF elements with no real stakes. Meh. nobody likes an installment in a popular franchise that features elements and names from previous installments but otherwise has no connection to them. The \"Silver Eyes\" screenplay(s) Basic Setup: Kira and I both worked on three versions of a Silver Eyes screenplay over the course of about a year, trying to find the right approach to the story from the first book. Problems: These were the first attempts I made myself to write a screenplay after realizing it was going to be difficult to find someone else who understood the lore well enough to do it. Unfortunately, it also meant these screenplays suffered greatly from my inexperience at writing. Even Kira, with her writing expertise, couldn't save them. Verdict: Although these had some good elements, I ultimately decided to focus on making a screenplay from the games and not from the books. tbh the book trilogy's kinda lame in comparison to the games. The \"Pawn Shop\" screenplay Basic Setup: A kid who watches after a pawn shop finds trouble when an animatronic is brought in. It turns out Freddy's had been robbed, and the animatronics were taken to different locations for sale. The other animatronics come to retrieve the one at the Pawn Shop, and the kid and his friends get roped into adventure. Problems: A creative approach, but felt a little too much like \"a boy and his animatronic\". Too much after-school adventure, not enough horror. Verdict: Seemed like a good idea at the time. pretty much a fnaf kids movie. The \"Cassidy\" screenplay Basic Setup: Diving deep, this screenplay packed in a lot of lore, following the story of Cassidy. Problems: Spanning multiple time-periods, following multiple characters, and featuring lore from multiple games, this was pretty saturated, saturated to a fault. It may have been satisfying to the most hardcore fans, but it would have left the majority of people confused and lost. (Hey wait, maybe this WAS the most accurate screenplay...) Verdict: Ultimately more of a visual encyclopedia than a movie, this just wasn't satisfying, even to me. Out. on one hand the screenplay sounds lore-heavy, giving fans tons of theory material (and could potentially answer some questions we've already asked in the past), and on the other hand it sounds boring. The \"Misfit Kid\" screenplay Basic Setup: Single Mom brings her kid to a new town; kid finds Freddy's; hilarity ensues. Problems: One of the problems in creating a modern day story with an old Freddy's setting is finding a way to connect the protagonists to the restaurant, finding a reason for them to be there, and finding a reason for them to stay. The problem here was that the reason for this kid to go to Freddy's and have misadventures was too contrived and too forced. Verdict: Not a bad setup, but it just didn't work. If I don't care about the characters, then there's a good chance no one else will either. Pass. (This was going to be THE screenplay for a while because it didn't have any serious flaws. I ultimately just decided it wasn't good enough though.) sounds ok, but a little too family friendly for a blumhouse movie. The \"Ghost Trackers\" screenplay Basic Setup: A group of amateur ghost-trackers sneak into the abandoned Freddy's. Problems: Although a very common-sense setup for this sort of movie, the problem again arose about how to give these characters a connection to Freddy's itself. What ended up happening was too much of the story went to their own backstories and their own hardships, and it took the spotlight away from the story of Freddy's. Verdict: A stronger connection between protagonist and Freddy's was needed. Lesson learned. sounds cool; yeah it has some flaws (and major ones too) but otherwise i'd watch it The \"Insane\" screenplay Basic Setup: Another ghost-tracker variation, this one involved the Funtime Animatronics, underground ball-pit tunnels, and a Marionette out for revenge! Problems: As some other screenplays ventured too far into adventure, this one went too far into action. Verdict: Too all-over-the-place, with too many characters doing too many things. sounds awesome, but also too action packed for people too keep up with the plot; wich essentially turns it into a michael bay movie, and nobody likes a michael bay movie. The \"Mike\" screenplay Basic Setup: Hmmmm. This makes sense. Why didn't I think of this before? Problems: Actually this is a good mix... it has the best pieces from all the previous screenplays... Not really any problems here. All the right characters, all the right motivations, all the right stakes... Verdict: Yeah, we're going with this one. It's fun, it's scary, and it has a great central story! ---- Oh right, so onto the bad news. The bad news is that there won't be any more screenplays to add to this list since we're officially making the \"Mike\" screenplay. Filming starts in Spring!!! :D LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOO",

As with everything, use the information to expand your thought processes, help you think about things differently, and inspire you to take action. And don't just read one book, read constantly. Take the good, forget the rest. Here are some other great books for you to read next: The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People (not really about being \"effective\") The Magic of Thinking Big The Richest Man in Babylon The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership How to Win Friends and Influence People The 4-Hour Workweek The Last Lecture Getting Things Done The Art of War Some books are more technical and process oriented. Some are more high level 30,000 foot view. Some are philosophical, some are tactical. I first read The 7 Habits (my all time top favorite book) when I was 18 years old. At the time, I took a nugget here and there about the Four Quadrants, ABC 123 list making, and planning systems. Most of the high level philosophical and life lessons content went right over my head. Over the last 18 years I have reread the book probably a dozen times and every time I get more out of it. When my children were young, I was really drawn to Covey's stories about difficulties in raising his children. As I grew my business, I got a lot out of rereading the lessons about leadership and interpersonal relationships. The book isn't necessarily a reflection of the author's life or moral compass. In this case, it's likely that Hill did actually spend a great deal of time studying successful people and compiling these habits/behaviors. But even then, this was 80 years ago, a lot has changed since then!! So read the book, take the inspiration and advice that you relate best to, and move on.",

One thing Hill said that stuck with me all these years and that is: \"Always do more that you are paid for.\" I had never heard that he might have been a con man. What matters to me is whether a person's advice feels worth following. You won't know if that works until you try living it. I can't think of anything Hill wrote that didn't make sense to me, or reinforce what felt right---to me. So I don't worry about whether he is passing on the advice of the great people of his time, or it came directly from him.",

So I was very disappointed when I looked up information on the author Napoleon Hill. He was a known con artist who would do anything to make a buck Well the question then is do you still find helpful the threads we see in this sub every week like \"How I made X million in 6 easy steps\" or \"Here's the [big accomplishment] and how I did it\", etc.  Are you sooooooooo inspired and vote down any doubting Thomases?  If the answer to those questions is yes, i.e. you like those threads by self-promoters and bullshitters (some doing a long con with set-up threads, claims of not selling anything while getting PMs of suckers to market to, etc.), then nothing wrong with that book. And Hill's advice is not necessarily bad in itself IF applied to ethical means of running a business.  But never make any one book the center of your business world view.  And the bottom line is that anything that actually inspires you to stop dreaming and start can't be all bad.",

They may provide some useful information, for example if someone mentioned Search engine optimisation, you looked it up, and learned about it. They give you learning opportunities, but they don't teach you anything solid. Knowing that everyone is in for money, and that you tubers get paid, movies aren't real, books cost money, etc can really kill the motivation. People are somewhat genuine, and their advice is trustable, but no one will tell you how to be successful, it's something you need to develop.",
