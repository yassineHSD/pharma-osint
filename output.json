[{"Comment": "Note that NTR is primarily a hentai/porn category. What often gets missed with NTR, and why it's different from cheating. Is that the target for the NTR and the person you're meant to identify with is the main character, so it's far closer to \"cuckolding\" than cheating. The whole purpose of it is that the sex/cheating is done in a way specifically to insult/degrade the main relationship, it's meant to instill the reader with anguish, anger, pain and such. So for example a cheating story would be something like the a lonely housewife falling for a young man that's moved into her appartment and them begining an affair. Can be NTR, but it's fairly mild. An NTR story would be an office worker bringing his boss back home with him for dinner, them getting drunk together, him passing out and the boss then co-ercing his wife into having sex with him in their bed, which she then loves and gets hooked on. It would then transition to things like the wife sucking the boss off at work under his desk, or having sex with him in the next room, all those kind'a things. The core aspect is that the guy is oblivious to it, but the wife and the boss are having sex in a way that's practically taunting him with their affair. You'd expect things like it to be repeatedly pointed out that the boss is a better lover, that he's got a bigger dick, that the wife doesn't care about her husband anymore. Probably will end with the wife pregnant and the husband raising another man's child. You've got similar stories for anything else, childhood friend being fucked while the guy she loves can't quite work up the courage to confess, etc etc. Think of it as romance destruction. It's meant to make the reader upset. It's not meant to be a pleasant thing. But with it being such a mainstream idea now, the term's been thrown around a lot and loses a lott'a meaning, then you have people saying things like \"It's fine, I self insert as the bad guy!\" which goes against the whole point of it.", "dateModified": "2017-03-12T10:28:46.000Z", "Qualification": "Positive", "upvoteCount": 40, "username": "DNamor", "author.type": "Person", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/5yxxu1/what_is_ntr_why_the_hate_towards_it/"}, {"Comment": "ntr isnt only cheating, its level above that... Im sure you already googled what ntr means so I will not repeat it. I will give you my personal definition of NTR. Its genre where MC/FMC will get mentally and/or physically destroyed but some dick/slut who doesnt give shit about them and will cheat them with all kind of people (could be  only one) and disrespect FMC/MC.  In end FMC/MC would walk in room and see their wife/gf/bf/gf/husband fuck with other person. ntr manga: <H-mate> <Drug candy> </Blush-DC.> (this one have good story for NTR) <Household affairs> (this one is not HC because it starts right away IMO) If you want real NTR stuff then I suggest to go to hentai sites (can recommend those too xD) and see what ntr means xD", "dateModified": "2017-03-12T09:34:49.000Z", "Qualification": "Positive", "upvoteCount": 10, "username": "PhysoTronic", "author.type": "Person", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/5yxxu1/what_is_ntr_why_the_hate_towards_it/"}, {"Comment": "https://youtu.be/KWRs8f35aCs", "dateModified": "2017-03-12T10:16:46.000Z", "Qualification": "Neutral", "upvoteCount": 3, "username": "leeways", "author.type": "Person", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/5yxxu1/what_is_ntr_why_the_hate_towards_it/"}, {"Comment": "http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=NTR", "dateModified": "2017-03-12T09:33:04.000Z", "Qualification": "Neutral", "upvoteCount": 3, "username": "Caved", "author.type": "Person", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/5yxxu1/what_is_ntr_why_the_hate_towards_it/"}, {"Comment": "I personally don't hate ntr, I personally don't hate any plot device. I think all could be used amazingly well but also horribly wrong. First the proper meaning of NTR is when the protagonist partner whom they are DATING is taken away from them, so yeah cheating. But over time people started overgeneralising the word to love triangles or even when girl has never noticed MC before but starts dating someone else. Why? because ntr has a more negative connotation to it. (Not advocating for anything but it's the best example i can think of)  Paedophilia, it means attraction to prepubescent kids, but the word has been generalised to include anyone under 17 to get a more negative response. It's just a thing humans do, there so many words that have been overgeneralised with it's negative connotation. Although i won't say that it's the only reason. Well some people like to self insert themselves into the protagonist shoes, so if the protagonist has a harem, they have a harem.(probably why harem anime/manga has a stable market) So when the girl is taken away from the MC she's taken away from them, and of course they won't like that. So same thing now starts to happen in situations that have been generalised under ntr, they are already unconsciously having a negative reaction to it. Now the problem with real NTR is that it has been used lazily most of the time. I really haven't seen a manga where i saw ntr and didn't feel like it wasn't forced.", "dateModified": "2017-03-12T10:25:12.000Z", "Qualification": "Negative", "upvoteCount": 3, "username": "Trobis", "author.type": "Person", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/5yxxu1/what_is_ntr_why_the_hate_towards_it/"}, {"Comment": "In a nutshell. Ntr (as a whole) is a form of plot focused onto describe the manner in which a character is deprived of something he/she treasures; being this something as concrete as a partner or merely abstract as a friendship or its sense of trust. In regular manga NTR is not synonim of cheating, instead, is used as drama fuel aimed to problematize the emotional (usually romatic) relationship between two or more actors, and usually do not have further consecuences. Menwhile in Hentai manga NTR is used as representation of cheating, betrayal or infidelity, and it's always a consequence.", "dateModified": "2017-03-12T11:02:18.000Z", "Qualification": "Positive", "upvoteCount": 1, "username": "GrindEnfant", "author.type": "Person", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/5yxxu1/what_is_ntr_why_the_hate_towards_it/"}, {"Comment": "Note that there are two forms: netorare and netori. Both are essentially the same thing, that is a person being cuckolded by their relationship partner. The difference is in whom you you are meant to empathize with: the person being cuckolded in the case of netorare, and the person 'stealing' the partner in the case of netori. Netorare tends to have a lot of superficial hate towards it because it's meant to make you feel shitty with heavy emotional effect and so on, so it's not something a lot of people want to read. There's also the issue that it's poorly used to make some lots of truly terrible hentai.", "dateModified": "2017-03-12T11:05:25.000Z", "Qualification": "Negative", "upvoteCount": 1, "username": "Strowy", "author.type": "Person", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/5yxxu1/what_is_ntr_why_the_hate_towards_it/"}, {"Comment": "please run away from NTR, You still safe and pure ...

A close approximation is \"cuckold\". The term kind of changed meaning when more people used it, like \"moe\". It's more of a joke now.
